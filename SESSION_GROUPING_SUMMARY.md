# Session-Based Review History Update - Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Implemented

### Enhanced Database Query
- Updated `get_reviews()` method in `DatabaseManager` class to support session-based grouping
- Added `group_by_session` parameter to organize reviews by session ID
- Sessions are ordered by their start time (earliest review in each session)
- Within each session, reviews are ordered chronologically

### Updated UI Display
- Modified the "Recent Reviews" section to display "Recent Review Sessions"
- Reviews are now grouped by session ID and displayed with session information
- Each session shows:
  - Session ID (abbreviated)
  - Session start date
  - Number of files in the session
  - List of all files processed in that session

### Session Tracking
- Each user session generates a unique UUID that persists until the page is refreshed
- All reviews saved during a session are tagged with the same `session_id`
- This allows grouping of multiple file analyses performed in one user session

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Database Schema
The `reviews` table already included the `session_id` column for tracking sessions.

### Key Query Logic
```sql
SELECT r.*, s.session_start_time, s.session_review_count
FROM reviews r
JOIN (
    SELECT session_id, 
           MIN(created_date) as session_start_time,
           COUNT(*) as session_review_count
    FROM reviews 
    WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY session_id
) s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
ORDER BY s.session_start_time DESC, r.created_date ASC
```

### UI Improvements
- Sessions are displayed in containers with clear session headers
- Each session shows a compact table of files processed
- Sessions are sorted by most recent first
- Session limit functionality to control how many sessions to display

## ðŸ§ª Testing
- Created `test_session_grouping.py` to verify the session grouping logic
- Validated that multiple files in one session are grouped together
- Confirmed that sessions are properly sorted by time

## âœ… Result
Users can now see their review history organized by sessions, making it easy to:
- Track which files were processed together in one session
- Review the chronological order of their analysis work
- Understand their review patterns and productivity

The app now provides a much more organized and intuitive view of review history!
