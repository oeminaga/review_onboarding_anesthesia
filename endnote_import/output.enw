%X Women anesthesiologists face many challenges when trying to advance their careers and find balance in personal and professional endeavors. In this article, we introduce the reader to several concepts central to understanding the challenges faced by mid-career women anesthesiologists and highlight why these challenges become particularly pronounced when women enter the mid-career stage. We describe how lack of constructive actionable feedback combined with lack of mentorship and sponsorship negatively affects women in the workplace. We also outline barriers and bias that mid-career women anesthesiologists face in high-level leadership roles along with the disproportionally high burden of nonpromotable work. We present a discussion of mistreatment and burnout, which are compounded by concurrent demands of parenthood and a professional career. We conclude with the impact that these barriers have on mid-career women anesthesiologists and recommendations for mitigating these challenges. They include a systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, an individualized professional development strategy, and an improved and comprehensive approach to promotion.

%X The objective of this study was to ascertain whether the addition of part-task training as a step in Pecha Kucha for fiberoptic tracheal intubation increases the success rate and reduces the complication rate. The residents of the Department of Anesthesiology were initially included in an orientation program. We used the Pecha Kucha method for the presentation of teaching fiberoptic intubation skills. Afterwards the participants were trained in Laerdal® airway management and each participant performed tracheal intubation using the Aintree catheter. The participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 9) received part-task training and group 2 (n = 9) received whole-task training. The tracheal intubation performances of participants were evaluated on fresh frozen cadavers. The number of interventions, incidence of complications, success rate, and optimization maneuver requirements were recorded. Eighteen residents aged between 27 and 33 years were included. All were junior residents with less than 2 years of experience. There was no significant difference in terms of duration of tracheal intubation, complication rates, and optimization maneuvers between the study groups. Six participants could not place the tracheal tube in the last section. The success rates for the part-task group during Aintree and tracheal tube placement were 100 and 66.7%, respectively, whereas the rates were 55.6 and 44.4%, respectively, in whole-task group (p < 0.05). In addition to the Pecha Kucha method in fiberoptic intubation training, simulation-based part-task training appears to increase the success rate and to reduce the complication rate on fresh frozen cadavers.

%X An academic anesthesiology department benefits from recruiting faculty from various centers, from new graduates to experienced clinicians. Two critical objectives for a department are getting the faculty members up-to-speed thoroughly and efficiently and retaining the faculty members to benefit from their contributions over time. Onboarding plays a pivotal role in meeting both objectives. A successful onboarding process is critical to the enculturation of new employees into an existing work environment. Organizations focusing on improving onboarding practices increase overall success, decrease attrition, and enhance member performance and satisfaction. In this study, we examine our onboarding practices and then create structured tools to improve our processes. A survey gauging the effectiveness and satisfaction of our existing onboarding practices was administered to 11 faculty members hired between 2016 and 2018. Using feedback from the survey, our team identified critical components for improvement and quality measures for onboarding from before faculty arrival until after starting clinical duties. We also measured faculty satisfaction with the onboarding process at different time points. Updated onboarding practices targeting identified areas were implemented in one hiring cycle. Thirteen new faculty members hired over the course of the course of six months assessed the new system's effectiveness. The experience of the previous cohort was compared to the new cohort, highlighting the impact of their feedback on the onboarding process. Our new best practices model, implemented to address primary gaps in our system, has shown promising results. The post-intervention cohort reported more favorable responses to the process, suggesting a positive shift in the onboarding experience. Further free-text feedback included recommendations for additional updates, offering a proactive approach to continuous improvement. A structured, feedback-responsive onboarding process improved the overall experience for new hires. While the response was overwhelmingly positive, further refinement with subsequent iterations is needed to continually improve this process.

%X Behind every successful physician there are mentors to light the path. Ralph Waters, founder of the anesthesiology residency at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was an instrumental part of Virginia Apgar's success; his support of her education and promotion of her professional endeavors proved to shape the medical powerhouse that Apgar would become. In this article, we learn about the professional and personal relationship between Waters and Apgar through personal correspondence from the Ralph Waters Collection at University of Wisconsin Archives, scientific publications, and meeting records. Through his support of her career, she was able to achieve success despite the Great Depression, World War II, and the novelty of being a woman in medicine. In her career, Apgar became the first female full professor at Columbia University, designed and implemented the Apgar score, and led the Division of Congenital Malformations at the March of Dimes among many other accomplishments. Though they lived half of a country apart in Wisconsin and in New York, the mentor and mentee bridged the gap in geography through regular correspondence, American Society of Anesthetists (now American Society of Anesthesiologists) meetings (where Waters served as president and Apgar as treasurer), and exchange of trainees between the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Columbia University. Apgar revealed herself to be a persistent, hardworking, intelligent, and passionate academic physician - the perfect pupil for Waters. This article's aim is to underscore the importance of mentorship - with equal commitment to the relationship from mentor and mentee - then and now.

%X The transition to residency (TTR) goes along with new opportunities for learning and development, which can also be challenging, despite the availability of preparation courses designed to ease the transition process. Although the TTR highly depends on the organization, individual combined with organizational strategies that advance adaptation are rarely investigated. This study explores residents' strategies and experiences with organizational strategies to help them adapt to residency. We conducted a template analysis of interview transcripts with 16 second-year residents from different hospital-based specialties in the Netherlands. To identify residents' perceptions of their own and other healthcare professionals' strategies, our template consisted of the individual and organizational strategies originating from the Organizational Socialization theory. Residents employed five individual strategies: observing, asking questions, establishing social relationships, and seeking information. These strategies helped them learn their tasks, appropriate behaviors, and integrate into their teams. On the organizational side, residents experienced six strategies, mapped through Organizational Socialization theory. Collective-individual: whether the residents felt they were treated as a group or as individuals. Formal-informal: whether the introduction period was formal, structured and explicit, or implicit and unstructured. Sequential-random: whether guidance was aligned with training levels or approached inconsistently. Fixed-variable: whether the residency program followed a fixed timeline or a flexible structure. Serial-disjunctive whether role models or experienced professionals were available for guidance or not. Investiture-divestiture: whether the healthcare team embraced residents' individuality or emphasized residents' conformity to norms. Factors influencing TTR included individual strategies, such as establishing social relationships, and organizational strategies, particularly interactional (relationships with healthcare professionals) and systemic strategies (training program structure). Residents' perceptions varied on whether these strategies facilitated or hindered their TTR. TTR involves dynamic interactions between residents and healthcare professionals, bridging individual and organizational strategies. This largely unexplored interaction adds a new dimension to Organizational Socialization theory. Importantly, residents' perceptions of these strategies varied: some thrived with independence, while others needed structured guidance. This suggests that residency programs should customize support to individual needs, balancing support and autonomy to improve transitions and enhance training.

%X Mentorship has been shown to improve career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians. There is a current lack of studies investigating factors that either promote or hinder effective mentoring relationships through the perspectives of both faculty and residents. The aim of this study was to ascertain these factors and subsequently to provide guidance on designing residency mentorship programs. We used a qualitative design to examine mentorship experiences at the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology and conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 residents and 12 faculty in the mentorship program. Data were analyzed iteratively using a constant comparative method to identify themes resulting in positive or negative mentorship outcomes. As determined from both mentor and mentee perspectives, a successful mentorship program hinges on three key factors-i.e., the anticipated goals of a mentorship relationship, characteristics of the participants, and the structure of the program. When themes were compared between mentors and mentees, differences in their perception of the goals of the relationship and the structure of the program resulted in cases of disillusionment and negative mentorship outcomes. The concept of a mentorship network emerged as a possible solution that would meet the evolving needs of mentees as they progress through training. The network would involve each mentee acquiring multiple mentors, with each providing guidance for a mentee's diverse areas of interest. We identified three key factors that facilitate or hinder mentorship relationships and proposed solutions for designing effective mentorship programs for postgraduate training programs.

%X Pain fellowship programs are facing unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions by state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for today's fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to maintain proper education and ensure the well-being of our trainees. We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors, offering guidance and recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationwide. Panel members evaluate the best available evidence and expert opinion on use of remote and virtual platforms in clinical care, adaptability to alterations in clinic and referral management, and provide guidance on postgraduate impact. The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been significant and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Several strategies will help address these challenges, including employing telehealth capabilities to continue clinical experiences and providing trainees with opportunities to continue their professional growth beyond fellowship completion. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to overcome these challenges.

%X the blended SORT-IT model uses a combination of online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors to teach operational research. We modified SORT-IT to create the Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course directed to anesthesiology residents in Kigali, Rwanda. This course takes students from an initial research idea through submitting a paper for publication. Our viewpoint on entering this study was that ACOR participants would have adequate resources to complete the course, but be hampered by cultural unfamiliarity with the blended teaching approach. we conducted a qualitative analysis of the experiences of all those who participated in the ACOR course to understand obstacles and improve future course iterations. Six anesthesiology residents participated in the first iteration of the course, with 4 local mentors and 2 secondary mentors, one of whom was based at the University of Virginia, with a total of 12 participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants and mentors, which were independently coded for topics by two reviewers. there was a 50% publication rate for those enrolled in the course and an expected 100% acceptance rate for those who completed the course. Some reported benefits to the course included improved research knowledge, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange. Some reported obstacles to successful course completion included time limitations, background knowledge, and communication. Of note, only 4 out of 12 participants recognized cultural barriers. although successful in the sense that all participants completed their research project, ACOR did not fully solve the main issues hindering research training. Our results show that research training in low-resource settings needs a continuing and formal focus on the factors that hinder participants´ success: mentorship and time.

%X Given the evolution of competency-based education and evidence supporting the benefits of incorporating simulation into anesthesiology residency training, simulation will likely play an important role in the training and assessment of anesthesiology residents. Currently, there are little data available regarding the current status of simulation-based curricula across US residency programs. In this study, we assessed simulation-based training and assessment in US anesthesiology programs using a survey designed to elicit information regarding the type, frequency, and content of the simulation courses offered at the 132 Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education-certified anesthesiology training programs. The response rate for the survey was 66%. Although most of the responding programs offered simulation-based courses for interns and residents and during CA-1 orientation, the curriculum varied greatly among programs. Approximately 40% of responding programs use simulation for resident assessment and remediation. The majority of responding programs favored standard simulation-based training as part of residency training (89%), and the most common perceived obstacles to doing so were time, money, and human resources. The results from this survey highlight that there are currently large variations in simulation-based training and assessment among training programs. It also confirms that many program directors feel that standardizing some components of simulation-based education and assessment would be beneficial. Given the positive impact simulation has on skill retention and operating room preparedness, it may be worthwhile to consider developing a standard curriculum.

%X The representation of women among leaders in the field of anesthesia continues to trail that of their male counterparts. This qualitative study was conducted to understand the pathway of leadership acquisition among women in the field of anesthesiology. Using constructivist grounded theory, we sought to determine whether there were specific internal or external factors that were common to women in leadership in the specialty field of anesthesiology, and specifically, how they obtained leadership positions. Semistructured interviews were conducted for data collection. A total of 26 women in leadership positions in anesthesiology participated in this study. The analysis of these interviews resulted in the development of 4 common themes related to career pathways for these women in leadership. Each theme was examined in depth to determine the qualities necessary for individuals to advance in the field and the pathway to obtaining leadership positions. The findings of this study showed that early-career, high-value mentorship and sponsorship were important factors in leadership acquisition. Most participants (n = 20; 76%) had early mentors. Of those with early mentorship, 13 (65%) had high-value mentors, who we define as someone with power or authority. Sponsorship was the leading factor contributing to leadership acquisition. The results of this qualitative study may serve as a guide for encouraging female anesthesiologists with leadership aspirations. We suggest that the specialty field of anesthesiology institute targeted measures to help increase the percentage of women leadership with formal sponsorship programs at the local and national levels.

%X Simulation is increasingly used in medical teaching. Various studies have evaluated different simulation models for training of regional anesthesia (RA). We compared the use of human cadaver and blue phantom models for training of regional anesthesia to novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology. Fifty students were taught knobology of the ultrasonography (USG) machine. They were divided into two equal groups by computer-generated random number table, and the groups assigned were kept in sealed envelopes. In group BP, students were trained on a blue phantom model, and in group HC, students were trained on human cadaver. After training, a didactic video of sonoanatomy of the supraclavicular block was shown to all participants. The block performance was then judged on patients requiring supraclavicular block. The primary objective of the study was to compare the block performance time, and secondary objectives were the quality of image acquired, orientation of transducer to the target, identification of ultrasound artifacts, errors committed, complications, and success rate. The mean block performance time was shorter in group HC compared to group BP (451.96 ± 50.25 and 526.48 ± 43.486 s, respectively;  Cadaver-based training produced better results compared to blue phantom simulator model for teaching of ultrasound-guided RA to novice postgraduate trainees of anesthesiology.

%X Assessment of the current literature surrounding interventions directed toward the prevention of burnout in the field of medicine and particularly in anesthesiology. Recently, burnout has been noted to lead to medication errors and subsequently increased harm to our patients. On a personal level, burnout can lead to depression and even suicide amongst physicians. Strategies to prevent burnout amongst anesthesiologists that have been studied in the literature include multisource feedback, mentorship and early recognition. There remains no clear or definitive intervention to prevent burnout for physicians. However, changing our environment to embrace mentorship, the continual exchange of feedback and the fostering self-care could startlingly improve our work environment.

%X Clinical investigation serves a vital role to advance treatment and management stratgies for patients with pain. For those new to clinical investigation, key advice for both the novice clinical-investigator and the experienced researcher expanding to translational work may accelerate research efforts. To review foundational material relevant to junior investigators focusing on pain clinical trials, with an emphasis on randomized controlled trials. We reviewed recent publications and resources relevant to clinical investigators, with a particular emphasis on pain research. Understanding the approaches and barriers to clinical pain research is a first step to building a successful investigative portfolio. Key components of professional development include motivation, mentorship, and collaborative approaches to research. Many junior clinical-investigators face challenges in pursing research careers and sparking iterative progress towards success in clinical trials. Pain-specific research metrics and goals-including hypothesis development, study design considerations, and regulatory concerns-are also important considerations to junior investigators who pursue clinical trails. Approaches to build toward collaborative and independent funding are essential for investigators. This work provides a foundation for understanding the clinical research process and helps inform the goals and plans of clinical-investigators.

%X Mentorship in medicine is associated with increased career satisfaction and personal development. Despite these benefits, little is known about mentorship in anesthesiology training programs. Our objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of formal mentorship programs among anesthesiology training programs in Canada, (2) the prevalence of informal and formal mentorship among anesthesiology residents in Canada, and (3) the predictors of having an identified mentor among anesthesiology residents in Canada. We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey of residents and program directors from Canadian anesthesiology residency programs. Program directors were questioned about formal mentorship programs, and residents were asked to provide demographic data and information about their mentorship relationships. We analyzed the relationship between resident characteristics and mentorship. Our survey response rates were 76% and 39% for the Program Director Survey and the Resident Survey, respectively. Formal mentorship programs were present in 54% of residency training programs, and 94% of residents agreed that mentorship was important. Seventy-four percent of residents identified at least one mentor, although 42% of these residents did not interact regularly with their mentor. Mentors and mentees were more likely to be of the same gender. If a formal mentorship program was present, residents were more likely to identify a mentor (82 vs 17%) and interact regularly with their mentor (70 vs 46%). Formal mentorship programs were present in half of anesthesiology training programs. Although 74% of the residents identified a mentor, 42% did not interact regularly with their mentor. The presence of a formal mentorship program was positively associated with mentorship.

%X An important mission of academic medical departments is to further the scholarship and education of its junior faculty. In 2013, Hindman et al. described the design and initial outcomes of a faculty development program for junior faculty at the University of Iowa Department of Anesthesia. In the current study, we reassessed whether the program increased the production of publications long-term. We included all department faculty, years before joining the department, and years after leaving the department, to control for the effects of simply being current faculty in the department, benefiting from its resources, and having had progressively more experience working. The population studied was the faculty for any period between January 2006 and December 2022. The dependent variable was the count of publications in Scopus each year with the faculty member's Scopus identifier, 1996 through 2022. The two-year faculty development program included non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies. Statistical analyses were with logistic and Poisson random effect models for panel data, with standard errors estimated using jackknife resampling. Among the 128 distinct faculty in the department from 2006 through 2022, the 10% with the most publications per year accounted for 54% of the total annual publications. The two-year program was completed by 41% (53/128). Completion of the faculty development program was associated with a 17% absolute increase in the predicted marginal probability of one or more publications per year, from 25% to 41%. The 95% confidence interval for the 17% absolute increase was 9% to 24% (P < .0001). The predictive marginal effect of completing the program was 1.7 more publications per year per faculty (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.4, P < .0001). The estimate was also 1.7 more publications per year while limiting consideration to the 108 faculty who joined the department after 1996 and including as an independent variable the count of publications the year before joining the department. A faculty development program for junior faculty can reliably increase the production of publications in an anesthesiology department by at least one per year. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in publication production among faculty.

%X The challenges facing the health care industry in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic world are numerous, jeopardizing wellness, and performance. Maintaining engagement and fulfillment of anesthesiologists in their work is now a critical issue in various practice settings: academic, private practice, and corporate medicine. In this article, we offer insights on how mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship are important in the advancement of the anesthesiology workforce including women and underrepresented minorities inclusive of race, gender, and disability. Mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship require a framework that intentionally addresses the programmatic structures needed to optimize the environment for increasing women, underrepresented minorities, and other diverse groups. These 3 distinct yet interrelated concepts are defined with a discussion on the value of implementation. In addition, the concept of "belonging" and its importance in enhancing the culture in anesthesiology is explored. We believe that part of the solution to wellness, recruitment and retention and improved job satisfaction of clinicians is having an environment where mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship are foundational.

%X As anaesthesiologists face increasing clinical demands and a limited and competitive funding environment for academic work, the sustainability of academic anaesthesiologists has never been more tenuous. Yet, the speciality needs academic anaesthesiologists in many roles, extending beyond routine clinical duties. Anaesthesiologist educators, researchers, and administrators are required not only to train future generations but also to lead innovation and expansion of anaesthesiology and related specialities, all to improve patient care. This group of early career researchers with geographically distinct training and practice backgrounds aim to highlight the diversity in clinical and academic training and career development pathways for anaesthesiologists globally. Although multiple routes to success exist, one common thread is the need for consistent support of strong mentors and sponsors. Moreover, to address inequitable opportunities, we emphasise the need for diversity and inclusivity through global collaboration and exchange that aims to improve access to research training and participation. We are optimistic that by focusing on these fundamental principles, we can help build a more resilient and sustainable future for academic anaesthesiologists around the world.

%X Clinical production pressure is a significant problem for faculty of anesthesiology departments who seek to remain involved in research. Lack of protected time to dedicate to research and insufficient external funding add to this long-standing issue. Recent trends in funding to the departments of anesthesiology and their academic output validate these concerns. A 2022 study examining National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant recipients associated with anesthesiology departments across 10 years (2011-2020) outlines total awarded funds at $1,676,482,440, with most of the funds awarded to only 10 departments in the United States. Of note, the total 1-year NIH funding in 2021 for academic internal medicine departments was 3 times higher than the 10-year funding of anesthesiology departments. Additionally, American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) diplomats represent a minority (37%) of the anesthesiology researchers obtaining grant funding, with a small number of faculty members receiving a prevalence of monies. Overall, the number of publications per academic anesthesiologist across the United States remains modest as does the impact of the scholarly work. Improving environments in which academic anesthesiologists thrive may be paramount to successful academic productivity. In fact, adding to the lack of academic time is the limited bandwidth of senior academic physicians to mentor and support aspiring physician scientists. Given then the challenges for individual departments and notable successes of specialty-specific collaborative efforts (eg Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research [FAER]), additional pooled-resource approaches may be necessary to successfully support and develop clinician scientists. It is in this spirit that the leadership of

%X Mentorship is important for professional and academic growth; however, the role of mentorship in anesthesia is still being defined. We surveyed Canadian anesthesia residents to explore their perceptions of mentorship relationships. We administered a 20-item cross-sectional survey to program directors and anesthesia residents in all Canadian departments of anesthesia. Program directors were asked about their mentorship programs, and residents were asked about their perceptions of benefits and barriers to effective mentoring. Sixteen of 17 (94%) program directors and 189 of 585 (32%) anesthesia residents responded to our survey. While 143 of 180 (79%) residents agreed that mentorship was beneficial to overall success as an anesthesiologist, only 11 of 16 (69%) program directors reported formal mentorship as part of their residency program, and only 119 of 189 (63%) residents reported access to a mentor. Barriers reported by residents included insufficient time with mentors, lack of formalized meeting times and objectives, mentor-mentee incompatibility (personal or professional), and lack of resident choice in mentor selection. Our study confirms that, despite positive perceptions among residents, mentorship remains underutilized in anesthesia programs. We identify barriers to effective mentorship, including the need to consider resident choice as a means to improve formal anesthesia mentorship programs.

%X The objective of this study was to design and implement a preclinical elective (termed selective) in anesthesiology, critical care, and perioperative medicine and to report survey results assessing the impact of the selective on first- and second-year medical students' understanding of basic concepts, comfort with procedural skills, and interest in the specialty. Preinvention and postintervention survey evaluation was used as the design of this study. The study was conducted at Mayo Medical School and Mayo Clinic. The participants in this study are first- and second-year medical students. A 1-week introductory anesthesiology curriculum was developed to include didactic sessions, shadowing experiences, lunch and dinner panels, mentorship and networking opportunities, and procedural workshops in airway management, ultrasound, and vascular access techniques. Preselective and postselective surveys using a 10-point scale (1, strongly disagree; 10, strongly agree) were administered 1 week before and after the selective. A total of 8 students participated in the selective, with a 100% survey response rate. Students reported significant increases for all survey questions regarding basic concepts and skills. The largest increases were reported in comfort with airway management skills, understanding of the perioperative surgical home model, and vascular access skills. All participants indicated a higher likelihood of pursuing anesthesiology as a career and attributed their increased interest in anesthesiology to the selective. This new selective was successful in giving first- and second-year medical students a comprehensive overview of anesthesiology and increasing medical student interest in the specialty. The success of this selective leads to promising belief that similar peer-designed educational experiences can be developed at other medical schools to improve education and interest in this area of medicine.

%X Novice anesthesiology residents must acquire new technical, cognitive, and behavioral skills as they transition into the high-stakes perioperative environment. Simulation-based education improves procedural skill and behavior, and it permits deliberate practice with feedback; exposure to uncommon, high-consequence events; assessment; reproducibility; and zero risk to patients. We introduced a 5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) in 2006 for first-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s) and report over a decade of experience assessing its impact on self-efficacy, value, feasibility, and sustainability. All CA-1s in our residency program participated in the SBC as part of orientation. Participants completed 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with a private debriefing session from an attending anesthesiologist in our simulation center. We measured their self-reported confidence, which we report as self-efficacy (SE), the belief in one's own ability to successfully execute a skill or behavior necessary for a desired outcome, for 25 basic anesthesia skills before and after course completion. Participants also completed a postcourse evaluation. Of the 281 CA-1s who participated in the course from 2006 to 2016, we collected data on 267 (95%). SE improved over the course of SBC for all 25 individual skills ( SBC increases SE, is feasible, valuable to participants, and sustainable with remarkably consistency over the study period.

%X Comprehensive educational initiatives in ultrasound for practicing physicians are lacking. We developed a perioperative ultrasound training program for faculty to offer a broad orientation to the principles and clinical applications of ultrasound. The program consisted of two phases. Phase one, which introduced ultrasound via didactic and hands-on components, had six live sessions. At the end of each, participants completed a knowledge quiz. During the sixth session, faculty participated in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). For phase two, faculty attended two to three sessions (8-10 hours each) of in-depth individualized training and demonstrated supervised performance of ultrasound-related procedures of their choice. Participants included Anesthesia faculty at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. On average 30 faculty members attended each live session for phase one; 12 completed phase two. There was a significant difference in quiz scores across the six sessions (p < 0.001) with scores for Session 6 being significantly higher than for Session 1 (p < 0.001). The average mean and median scores on the three OSCE stations were 95.63% and 98.33%, respectively. For phase two, the 8 participants who received training in regional anesthesia each performed > 10 blocks on patients over two days; 5 of the 7 participants who received training in transthoracic echocardiography each completed more than 15 examinations on simulators and 10 examinations on patients. It is possible to implement a departmental educational program for ultrasound to improve ultrasound knowledge and skills in practicing anesthesiologists.

%X A 4-week summer preceptorship offered first-year medical students early exposure to anesthesiology following their preclerkship courses in pharmacology and cardiopulmonary physiology. The main objective was to provide students with clinical skills and prepare them for rotations while immersing them in a unique experience, introducing a specialty not covered in core rotations. Participants were selected via their responses to an application. In addition to shadowing anesthesiologists, curriculum components included weekly faculty lectures on core aspects of anesthesiology (introductory basics, perioperative drugs, airway, and crisis management); multiple simulation labs (workstation setup, intubation clinics, intravenous and central line placement, ultrasound techniques); research opportunities; and mentorship from physicians and senior medical students. The program culminated in each student successfully leading a simulated case to receive a certificate of completion. A survey of 15 participants revealed significant improvements in ability to intubate ( This program accelerates clinical exposure for preclerkship students, providing insights into anesthesiology early in their medical journey. It provides research and mentorship, fosters professional growth, and enhances individual competitiveness for residency program applications.

%X The ongoing war in Ukraine has introduced many challenges to an already overburdened and resource-limited medical system. Longitudinal collaborations, material support, educational outreach, and surgical mentorship are essential for improving outcomes and standards of neurosurgical care in extreme settings such as in times of war. Operating in Ukraine since 2016 through the coordination of Razom, the Co-Pilot Project has organized multiple United States-based mission trips to Ukraine to support local physicians during wartime, including a trip between April and May of 2023. A team of two anesthesiologists, two neurosurgeons, a neurointerventional radiologist, and an industry representative providing technical expertise aided in the instruction and performance of complex neurosurgical and neurovascular procedures by Ukrainian physicians at St. Panteleimon Hospital and St. Nicholas Children's Hospital in Lviv. Such efforts are crucial for helping to address the sharp rise in elective neurosurgical volume caused by the increase in internally displaced persons in Western Ukraine since February 2022. In an illustrative case, the authors provide an in-depth description of a foramen magnum meningioma resection via a far lateral craniotomy in a 48-year-old female. Despite the supply shortages and logistical challenges brought on by war, the Co-Pilot Project continues to utilize a long-term approach to continually improve the operative capabilities of Ukrainian neurosurgeons through both in-person and virtual collaborations. It is hoped that the lessons learned from a recent trip to Ukraine will help to inform and inspire other global neurosurgery initiatives in the future.

%X Managing pediatric crises necessitates the acquisition of unique skills and confidence in its execution. Our aim was to develop and assess a curriculum based on the constructivist learning environment to enhance learning, orientation, and preparation of graduating pediatric anesthesiology fellows. Fifty pediatric anesthesiology fellows from 9 academic institutions in the United States were recruited for an advanced boot camp over a 2-year period. Training stations were developed using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions. The curriculum was evaluated using an anonymous survey that assessed knowledge, self-confidence, appropriateness of case-scenario complexity, and usefulness for transitioning into an independent practitioner on a Likert scale ( Ninety-eight percent of the fellows completed a survey. Fellow perceptions of the advanced boot camp was positive. The median scores (IQR) for knowledge, self-confidence, appropriateness of case complexity, and usefulness for transition in 2017 were 5 (3,5), 4.5 (3,5), 5 (3,5), and 5 (3,5), respectively, and 5 (3,5), 4.5 (3,5), 5 (4,5), and 5 (3,5), respectively, in 2018. The IQR in the assessment for an appropriate level of complexity for their level of training, narrowed in 2018 (4,5), when compared with 2017 (3,5). Fellow responses support the idea that the advanced boot camp provided tools and strategies for their transition. A narrowed IQR regarding the appropriate level of complexity of scenarios in 2018, when compared with 2017, might suggest an improvement in the curriculum.

%X Most congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) are detected antenatally. The majority of newborns are asymptomatic. Patients are prone to subsequent respiratory complications and to a lesser extent malignant transformation remains concerning. In Israel, until 2013, pediatric surgeries were performed by thoracotomy. To minimize its morbidity, we introduced thoracoscopy using a mentorship approach. We present our experience with thoracoscopic resections coordinated by the mentorship of a pediatric worldwide leader in his field and compare our results with resections performed by thoracotomy. A retrospective review of records of children operated between 2013 and 2020 was conducted. Data were compared using  Fifty patients were operated by thoracoscopy with a median age of 4 years, a thoracoscopic lobectomy performed in 68%. There was no conversion with a median length of stay (LOS) of 3½ days. Thirty patients were operated by thoracotomy by a thoracic surgeon with a median age of 3.5 years. A lobectomy was performed in 87% with a median LOS of 7 days. Thoracoscopic lobectomy is a technically demanding procedure with a long learning curve, strongly related to the low volume of cases. The role of a mentorship program in acquiring those surgical skills is crucial through standardization of the technique applied and supervised by the mentor. Early thoracoscopy for congenital pulmonary lesions at an early age can be achieved with a low conversion rate and minimal complications creating a change in the paradigm of practice when considering surgery for CPAM in Israel.

%X Background The transition from internship to clinical anesthesiology (CA) training is often difficult given the differences in workflow, procedures, environment, and clinical situations. The primary aims of this study were to determine if a standardized introductory bootcamp could improve clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level of new anesthesiology residents in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems. The secondary aim of the study was to see if a standardized bootcamp could be replicated at other programs. Methods The introduction to anesthesiology resident bootcamp was developed at one institution in 2015 then expanded to a second program in 2019. The bootcamp was a one-day experience consisting of simulation and task trainers that all rising first-year CA residents (CA-1) participated in during their first month of anesthesiology training. All participating residents were given a survey immediately before and after the bootcamp. The average ratings of the questions were calculated and used as the primary measure. The Anesthesia Knowledge Test (AKT) was used as a surrogate measure of participant knowledge. Results From 2015 to 2020, a total of 105 residents completed the pre-survey and 109 completed the post-survey across the two sites. The improvement in average rating was significant (Pre: 2.04±0.46 versus Post: 3.09±0.52 p<0.0001). Individual item analysis also showed significant improvement on all of the eight items (p<0.0001). Analyses by site revealed the same results at both average score and item level. There was no significant cohort difference in either AKT-0 (Control: 57.84±26.86 versus Intervention 50.13±25.14, p=0.14) or AKT-1 (Control: 41.06±26.42 versus Intervention 41.70±26.60, p=0.90) percentile scores. Conclusions Incorporation of an introduction to anesthesia bootcamp for new residents significantly improves participant comfort level and is reproducible across institutions. However, it does not improve resident performance on standardized tests.

%X To evaluate whether opioid prescriptions at discharge after Cesarean delivery decreased following implementation of a quality improvement bundle. A quality improvement bundle was instituted at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Interventions included opioid prescribing instructions in resident orientation, nursing and patient education, and standard electronic prescriptions. We used an interrupted time series study design and included patients who had a Cesarean delivery six months pre intervention and six months post intervention. Primary outcome data (opioids prescribed at discharge in morphine milliequivalents [MME]), were aggregated (averaged) by calendar week and analyzed using interrupted time series. Secondary outcomes were assessed using bivariate methods and included opioid use for breakthrough pain in hospital, and amount of opioids prescribed by prescriber specialty and training level. We included 2,578 women in our analysis. Based on the segmented regression analysis, prescribed opioids decreased from 97.6 MME in 2018 to 35.8 MME in 2019 (difference in means, - 61.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 72.2 to - 51.3; P < 0.001), and this decrease was sustained over the study period. Post intervention, there were no visits to our postnatal assessment clinic for inadequate pain control. A quality improvement bundle was associated with a marked and sustained decrease in discharge prescriptions of opioids post Cesarean delivery at a large Canadian tertiary academic hospital. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Déterminer si les ordonnances d’opioïdes au congé après un accouchement par césarienne avaient diminué à la suite de la mise en place d’un ensemble d’améliorations de la qualité. MéTHODE: Un ensemble d’améliorations de la qualité a été mis en place à l’Hôpital Mount Sinai de Toronto. Les interventions comprenaient des instructions de prescription d’opioïdes pendant l’orientation des résidents, la formation des soins infirmiers et des patients, ainsi que des ordonnances électroniques standard. Nous avons utilisé un plan d’étude de séries chronologiques interrompues et inclus des patientes ayant accouché par césarienne six mois avant et six mois après l’intervention. Les données sur le critère d’évaluation principal (soit les opioïdes prescrits au congé en équivalents de morphine en milligrammes [EMM]) ont été agrégées (moyennes) par semaine civile et analysées à l’aide de séries chronologiques interrompues. Les critères d’évaluation secondaires ont été estimés à l’aide de méthodes bivariées et comprenaient l’utilisation d’opioïdes pour les accès douloureux paroxystiques à l’hôpital, ainsi que la quantité d’opioïdes prescrits en fonction de la spécialité et du niveau de formation du prescripteur. RéSULTATS: Nous avons inclus 2578 femmes dans notre analyse. Selon l’analyse de régression segmentée, les opioïdes prescrits sont passés de 97,6 EMM en 2018 à 35,8 EMM en 2019 (différence de moyennes, − 61,7; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 %, − 72,2 à − 51,3; P < 0,001), et cette diminution s’est maintenue au cours de la période d’étude. Après l’intervention, il n’y a pas eu de visites à notre clinique d’évaluation postnatale pour remédier à un soulagement inadéquat de la douleur. CONCLUSION: Un ensemble d’améliorations de la qualité a été associé à une diminution marquée et soutenue des ordonnances d’opioïdes après les accouchements par césarienne dans un grand hôpital universitaire tertiaire canadien.

%X The transition into clinical anesthesiology is a challenging period that requires swift acquisition of clinical knowledge and procedural skills. Senior residents are in a prime position to help their junior colleagues into the operating room environment due to their ability to relate from personal experience. We created a workshop for enhancing peer apprenticeship during this transition. The workshop consisted of PowerPoint didactics interspersed with small-group practice sessions. Surveys were administered pre-, post-, 1-week post-, and 1-month postworkshop. The primary outcome was pre-post improvement in the proportion of residents prepared to be a trainer. Secondary outcomes included pre- to 1-week postworkshop improvement, pre-postworkshop change in knowledge of learning theory concepts, and pre-postworkshop change in first-year clinical anesthesiology perceptions of trainers. Of residents, 12 of 43 (28%) eligible to be resident trainers attended the workshop. The proportion of residents who felt prepared increased from 75% preworkshop to 100% postworkshop and remained at 93% at 1 week. Knowledge of cognitive load and microskills improved from 0% preworkshop to 83% postworkshop but dropped to 0% at 1 month. Comfort using microskills improved from 0% preworkshop to 83% postworkshop. Early anesthesiology training demands rapid acquisition of novel cognitive and procedural skills. Senior anesthesiology residents are in a prime position to train junior residents, yet many are uncomfortable with this role. We developed a workshop to transition residents into a peer trainer role and significantly increased their confidence to be a trainer. Other programs may benefit from implementing similar training.

As an attempt to understand this phenomenon, we targeted Riyadh Anesthesiology residents and program directors to explore their perception of mentorship relationships. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of mentorship in anesthesiology training and to assess the perspective of mentorship from anesthesiology residents. This was a cross-sectional study. We administered a 20-item validated cross-sectional survey to program directors and anesthesia residents to all Riyadh SCFHS anesthesiology departments. Residents were asked about their perceptions of barriers and benefits to effective mentoring. IBM SPSS version 23 and Microsoft Office Excel version 2010. Fifty anesthesiology residents and three program directors responded to our survey. The majority of residents agreed that mentorship was beneficial to the overall success as an anesthesiologist (36 of 50, 72%). Although all three program directors reported that a formal mentorship program is part of their residency program (3 of 3, 100%), only (25 of 50, 50%) responded with access to a mentor. Difficulties reported included lack of formalized meeting times, insufficient times with mentors, and mentor-mentee incompatibility. In conclusion, the study indicated the positive perspective and high principles to mentorship held by anesthesiology residents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It evidenced the beneficial, professional, and social impact that mentoring hails to the development of future anesthesiologists, and despite all that, it remains underutilized.

%X Residency programs in anesthesiology and intensive care (AIC), and emergency medicine (EM) continually evolve to ensure well-prepared trainees for these critical fields of healthcare. The objective of this study was to collect comprehensive feed-back from AIC and EM residents, comprising opinions and attitudes on: curriculum and structure of the residency program; scope of training environment, opportunities and complexity; training guidance and mentorship; teaching approach. An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among AIC and EM trainees during December 2023-January 2024 and June 2023-July 2023, respectively. Two hundred and thirty-five answers were collected: 137 (73/64 female/male) and 98 (55/43 female/male) respondents from the AIC and EM programs, respectively. Overall feed-back was equivalent for both residency programs, with differences related to the distinct characteristics of each medical specialty. The main issues identified across the programs were the need to improve and diversify the teaching approaches, with trainees' strong desire for more professional guidance, mentoring, and constant feed-back. The findings would inform decision-making beyond current residency programs in these critical care specialties, highlighting the need to design solutions for interactive and highly immersive educational experiences, such as simulation, augmented reality or virtual reality.

%X The transition from intern year to the first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1) is a challenging period for residents and their supervisors. Orientation methods and instructional material targeting this transition vary across U.S. residency programs. An un-pairing passport was implemented during the 2021-2022 transition to guide and provide expectations for interns, senior residents, and staff. The objective of this quality improvement project was to assess the effectiveness of the passport in improving the transition period and overall preparedness of the new CA-1s. We surveyed 3 groups (CA-1s, CA-2s/CA-3s, and staff anesthesiologists) 6 months after the completion of passport implementation to retrospectively assess the 2021-2022 CA-1 class's preparedness across 7 domains compared with those who transitioned before passport implementation. Mann-Whitney  Self-reflected preparedness scores of the CA-1s were higher across all domains compared with the senior resident group (r = 0.328-0.548). Overall level of comfort and preparedness for the start of the CA-1 year was higher in the postintervention group (r = 0.162- 0.514). Staff anesthesiologists' perceived preparedness of the residents was also higher across all domains for the postintervention group (r = 0.197-0.387). The un-pairing passport improved residents' and staff anesthesiologists' subjective assessments of the readiness of new CA-1 residents after a critical transition in their training. Similar tools can be more broadly applied to other anesthesiology residency and possibly fellowship programs as well as subspecialty rotations within those programs.

%X Central venous catheters (CVCs) are life-saving tools for fluid therapy during surgery. Ultrasound-guided CVC placement has been shown to be safe and highly efficient. However, it is difficult for medical workers with less experience in ultrasonography to acquire the necessary skill in a short time. Simulation-based training is a good way to enhance the skill of a beginner. Therefore, in this study, we introduced a new, inexpensive and easily implemented model for ultrasound-guided CVC placement training and assessed the feasibility of this model. This was a quasi-experimental study. Thirty-three anaesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents with strong CVC interest were included in a simulator-based training workshop in a department of anaesthesiology. The simulation model consisted of a piece of pork and two latex catheters filled with red and blue ink. The workshop comprised 3 parts: a 10-min introductory lecture, a 15-min orientation on performing ultrasound-guided CVC insertion based on the model, and a 30-min practice session. Participants completed relevant questionnaires before and after the training. Moreover, an examination was held to evaluate their skill with the novel model. All participants indicated that the novel model increased their self-perceived confidence in ultrasound-guided catheterization. They also all reported that the model was adequate for training anaesthesiology residents in ultrasound-guided catheterization. A few individuals thought the model did not mimic the progress of CVC insertion (3 of 33). After training, participants did not show a significant difference in the acquisition of central venous catheterization theory. However, their competency with ultrasound-guided CVC placement was enhanced. This was demonstrated not only based on subjective answers to the following questions, namely, "how do you perform central venous catheterization with ultrasound guidance?" (p < 0.001), "can you perform ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization?" (p < 0.001), and "how much self-confidence do you have in performing ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization?" (p < 0.001), but also in objective performance (evaluation of the core step in ultrasound-guided placement (p < 0.001)). The new simulator is a feasible, inexpensive and easily reproducible tool for training anaesthesiologists in ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization. After the simulation-based training workshop, the competency of residents in performing central venous catheterization with ultrasound guidance improved.

%X Mentorship has been identified as a key component of success in business and in academic medicine. After institutional review board approval of the study, an email survey was sent to anesthesiologists in one anesthesiology department to assess mentorship status. A survey link was sent to nonrespondents at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. All participants were deidentified. The identification of a mentor was compared by gender, academic rank, and years of practice. Among 233 anesthesiologists, 103 (44.2%) responded to the survey. More than 90% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that having a mentor is important to career success. Of the 103 respondents, 31 (30%) indicated they had a mentor. Overall, 84% of the identified mentors were men; however, this percentage differed significantly between men and women respondents (95% versus 60%; P = .03). Characteristics associated with having a mentor included younger age (P = .007), fewer years since finishing training (P = .004), and working full time (P = .02). For respondent age and years since finishing training, there was some evidence that the association was dependent on the gender of the respondent (age-by-gender interaction, P = .08; experience-by-gender interaction, P = .08). Anesthesiologists in this department believed that mentorship led to more academic success. Few women mentors were reported, and women were unlikely to identify a mentor once advanced past an assistant professor rank. Most respondents believed that mentorship was important for overall career success, but only approximately one-third identified a mentor at the time of the survey.

%X Since 2017, several regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellowship programs throughout the country have developed various educational didactic curriculums to address the core medical knowledge requirements as set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Given the paucity of existing literature regarding the medical knowledge acquisition of regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows, this study aimed to determine how quickly these fellows learn during their fellowship year, with a secondary aim of analyzing a new educational didactic curriculum in its goal of delivering the required medical knowledge. An 89-question, multiple-choice examination was administered to the 2020-2021 regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center during orientation and again at 4 months and 8 months into the fellowship. A secondary analysis of anonymous deidentified answers was completed. Fellows averaged 64%, 74%, and 79% correct responses on the orientation, 4-month, and 8-month exams, respectively. An analysis of the orientation exam revealed that the most commonly incorrect answers stemmed from topics including lower extremity nerve blocks, truncal blocks, and neuraxial anesthesia. The 4-month exam showed overall marked improvement; however, truncal blocks remained the most missed topic. Topics with 100% correct response rates in all examinations were local anesthetic pharmacology and systemic opioids. The results of this study indicate that a large portion of learning occurs during the first 4 months of the fellowship and slows thereafter. Using this simple form of fellowship evaluation, changes to an educational didactic curriculum can be implemented to reach medical knowledge goals more effectively and efficiently as required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

%X We conducted a survey of Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States to identify current practice regarding mentorship and teaching of topics related to career development. Program directors for all currently accredited Anesthesiology residency programs (N=129 as of April 2016) were contacted by e-mail and invited to complete a short internet survey. Two follow-up e-mails were sent at one-week intervals to those who had not yet responded. 59 program directors responded, yielding 53 complete responses, for an adjusted response rate of 41.1%. Program and practice management type (university versus other, hospital versus private) were not strongly associated with presence of a career development curriculum (CDC). In general, larger residency programs (30 or more residents) and university-based programs were more likely to provide lectures on specific CDC topics. Whether residency program directors agreed or disagreed with the premise that instruction should be provided on other topics besides anesthesia, was unrelated to the presence of CDC in their programs. The results of this survey demonstrate that the establishment of a mentorship program (even a rudimentary one) may be the first step in creating a CDC. Apart from having a CDC program already in place, the strongest predictor of CDC content was the size of the residency program. Though there are training programs that openly stated on our survey that they do not have a CDC in place, some of these programs still provided lectures on one or more of the topics surveyed.

%X Senior Instructors and Assistant Professors in their first academic appointment may not have all the tools for an efficient start to their careers. Although many institutions provide access to mentoring programs and seminars on faculty development, the timing and format of the offerings often conflict with ongoing responsibilities of the faculty, particularly clinical faculty. We established a collaboration between the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and the University of Rochester Medical Center Office for Faculty Development with the goal of developing a week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum that would better suit faculty schedules. We convened focus groups and with their help, identified themes for inclusion in the course. Speakers were identified from among local senior faculty. University leadership was enlisted in promoting the course. Individual speakers and course content were evaluated daily, at the end of the week-long course, and 6 months later. Planning for subsequent years incorporated the feedback. Yearly evaluations and subsequent course modification continued. Junior faculty from nearly every department in the Medical Center were represented. There was high learner satisfaction and participation however several limitations were identified and addressed in subsequent years. The focus on principles and available resources, not specific skills or content was appropriate. Daily interactions among participants from a wide variety of departments fostered networking among faculty who may not otherwise have met and discussed common interests. The ultimate value of such an early, intensive faculty development program will depend on whether it equips junior faculty to organize, develop, and achieve their academic goals better than alternative formats. This will require further study.

%X Mentorship is crucial to career advancement, medical education, and psychosocial support, especially for women and minorities. Although anesthesia mentoring programs have shown promise, there are no survey data regarding mentor-mentee relationship dynamics. This study aimed to explore the dynamics of the anesthesia mentor/mentee relationship. A open cross-sectional web-based survey was distributed by the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care and European Society of Regional Anesthesia to European anesthesiologists. Participation was anonymous and consent was obtained. The study evaluated responses relating to preferences, facilitators, and barriers to mentorship relationships along with sociodemographic information. In total, 543 anesthesiologists responded to the survey, and 406 (111 mentees, 49 mentors, 193 both, 53 neither) responded to questions regarding mentorship. 184 anesthesiologists identified as woman and 22 as other genders (non-binary, transgender, gender-fluid, and self-described gender). Moreover, 250 anesthesiologists identified as white. Both mentors and mentees indicated that personal compatibility was the most important factor for successful mentorship. Barriers to mentorship included time consumption and perceived lack of interest from the mentor and mentee. Both mentors and mentees benefited from this relationship. The former reported feeling helpful, and the latter supported the development of clinical skills. The mentors indicated that their participation was important for protecting against burnout/exhaustion and impostor syndrome. Participants reported a preference for mentorship programs organized at the departmental level, offered at the start of the anesthesiology education curricula. Women were more likely to feel a 'lack of interest' in mentoring them as a barrier (OR = 2.49, P = 0.033). Gender was a barrier for mentors of other genders (OR = 23.9, P = 0.0027) and ethnicity (OR = 48.0, P = 0.0023). White mentees found gender (OR = 0.14, P = 0.021) and ethnicity (OR = 0.11, P = 0.048) to be less important barriers to successful mentorship relationship. When possible, programs should prioritize matching mentors and mentees based on personal compatibility and experience in the mentee's area of interest. Addressing the perceived lack of interest in mentoring is essential for promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion within anesthesiology, as well as and uplifting women and minorities.

%X Learning ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia skills, especially needle/ beam alignment, can be especially difficulty for trainees, who can often become frustrated. We hypothesized that teaching novices to orient the transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders will improve performance on a standardized task, compared to holding the transducer and needle parallel to the shoulders. This study compared the effects of transducer orientation on trainees' ability to complete a standardized ultrasound-guided nerve block simulation. The time to task completion and percentage of the attempt time without adequate needle visualization were measured. Participants were right-handed healthy adults with no previous ultrasound experience and were randomly assigned to training in either transducer and needle alignment in a coronal plane, parallel to the shoulders (parallel group) or transducer and needle alignment in a sagittal plane, perpendicular to the shoulders (perpendicular group). Participants used ultrasound to direct a needle to 3 targets in a standardized gelatin phantom and repeated this task 3 times. Their efforts were timed and evaluated by an assessor, who was blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed on 28 participants. The perpendicular group was able to complete the task more quickly (P < .001) and with a smaller proportion of time lost to inadequate needle visualization (P < .001). Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia trainees complete a standardized task more quickly and efficiently when instructed to hold the transducer and needle in an orientation perpendicular to their shoulders.

%X Mentorship of residents has been extensively studied within many academic specialties, but not anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of formal mentorship programs among anesthesia residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the United States by surveying residency directors. The secondary goals of the study are to describe the programs that exist and identify areas that residency directors think should be the focus of mentoring. Our survey was designed based on previous surveys administered to residency program directors from other specialties. After determination of exempt status by our institutional review board, the survey was administered via e-mail to program directors of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited anesthesiology residencies. Response rate was 34% (45/131). The sample consisted of mainly university-based programs (93%). Most (88%) had a mentorship program in place. There was little consistency between methods of forming faculty-resident mentor pairs. Most mentors (84%) and mentees (79%) did not evaluate their programs. Nearly all program directors agree that mentorship is an important tool for resident development (90.6%) and that it is important to have a mentor during training (90.6%). Program directors identified the areas of career planning, professionalism, and achieving a balance between personal, career, and family demands to be the most valuable subjects to address in a mentoring relationship. Anesthesiology is currently underrepresented in the trainee mentoring literature. There is significant support for mentorship during resident training; however, the low rates of training for faculty and minimal evaluation by residents and faculty raise the question as to the efficacy of the existing programs. There is a need for more investigation of anesthesia residents' goals and perceptions of mentorship, and a more detailed evaluation of existing mentorship programs to determine the ideal structure of a mentoring program.

%X Research has shown that women have leadership ability equal to or better than that of their male counterparts, yet proportionally fewer women than men achieve leadership positions and promotion in medicine. The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) was founded within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) in 2018 as a multidimensional program to help address the significant career development, leadership, and promotion gender gap between men and women in anesthesiology. Herein, we describe WELI's development and implementation with an early assessment of effectiveness at 2 years. Members received an anonymous, voluntary survey by e-mail to assess whether they believed WELI was beneficial in several broad domains: career development, networking, project implementation and completion, goal setting, mentorship, well-being, and promotion and leadership. The response rate was 60.5% (92 of 152). The majority ranked several aspects of WELI to be very or extremely valuable, including the protégé-advisor dyads, workshops, nomination to join WELI, and virtual facilitated networking. For most members, WELI helped to improve optimism about their professional future. Most also reported that WELI somewhat or absolutely contributed to project improvement or completion, finding new collaborators, and obtaining invitations to be visiting speakers. Among those who applied for promotion or leadership positions, 51% found WELI to be somewhat or absolutely valuable to their application process, and 42% found the same in applying for leadership positions. Qualitative analysis of free-text survey responses identified 5 main themes: (1) feelings of empowerment and confidence, (2) acquisition of new skills in mentoring, coaching, career development, and project implementation, (3) clarification and focus on goal setting, (4) creating meaningful connections through networking, and (5) challenges from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the inability to sustain the advisor-protégé connection. We conclude that after 2 years, the WELI program has successfully supported career development for the majority of protégés and advisors. Continued assessment of whether WELI can meaningfully contribute to attainment of promotion and leadership positions will require study across a longer period. WELI could serve as a programmatic example to support women's career development in other subspecialties.

%X Attaining professional contentment can be challenging for many. Academic success, psychosocial support, and the confidence to provide excellent clinical care at the workplace are key pillars that can help build a sense of meaning in a career. The role of mentorship in facilitating these key pillars at different stages of pediatric anesthesia training and new independent practice is instrumental. For mentees aspiring for a career in pediatric anesthesia, there are several points of focus. Mentees should seek out mentors early in training, build on these relationships, and explore opportunities for peer mentorship as they advance in their career. For mentors, introducing mentees to the clinical and academic aspects of pediatric anesthesia and setting the foundation for the mentee to advance in their career can be both gratifying and stimulating. In this article, we explore the development and progression of a mentor-mentee relationship through training to the early career stage and its role in developing a meaningful career in pediatric anesthesia.

%X The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia launched the Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) in 2018 to empower highly productive women pediatric anesthesiologists to achieve equity, promotion, and leadership. WELI is focused on six career development domains: promotion and leadership, networking, conceptualization and completion of projects, mentoring, career satisfaction, and sense of well-being. We sought feedback about whether WELI supported members' career development by surveys emailed in November 2020 (baseline), May 2021 (6 months), and January 2022 (14 months). Program feedback was quantitatively evaluated by the Likert scale questions and qualitatively evaluated by extracting themes from free-text question responses. The response rates were 60.5% (92 of 152) for the baseline, 51% (82 of 161) for the 6-month, and 52% (96 of 185) for the 14-month surveys. Five main themes were identified from the free-text responses in the 6- and 14-month surveys. Members reported that WELI helped them create meaningful connections through networking, obtain new career opportunities, find tools and projects that supported their career advancement and promotion, build the confidence to try new things beyond their comfort zone, and achieve better work-life integration. Frustration with the inability to connect in-person during the coronavirus-19 pandemic was highlighted. Advisors further stated that WELI helped them improve their mentorship skills and gave them insight into early career faculty issues. Relative to the baseline survey, protégés reported greater contributions from WELI at 6 months in helping them clarify their priorities, increase their sense of achievement, and get promoted. These benefits persisted through 14 months. Advisors reported a steady increase in forming new meaningful relationships and finding new collaborators through WELI over time. All the members reported that their self-rated mentoring abilities improved at 6 months with sustained improvement at 14 months. Thus, programs such as WELI can assist women anesthesiologists and foster gender equity in career development, promotion, and leadership.

%X Recognizing the unmet need for surgical care in Ethiopia, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) has pioneered innovative methodologies for surgical system development with Saving Lives through Safe Surgery (SaLTS). SaLTS is a national flagship initiative designed to improve access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system. Sustained commitment from the FMOH and their recruitment of implementing partners has led to notable accomplishments across the breadth of the surgical system, including but not limited to: (1) Leadership, management and governance-a nationally scaled surgical leadership and mentorship programme, (2) Infrastructure-operating room construction and oxygen delivery plan, (3) Supplies and logistics-a national essential surgical procedure and equipment list, (4) Human resource development-a Surgical Workforce Expansion Plan and Anaesthesia National Roadmap, (5) Advocacy and partnership-strong FMOH partnership with international organizations, including GE Foundation's SafeSurgery2020 initiative, (6) Innovation-facility-driven identification of problems and solutions, (7) Quality of surgical and anaesthesia care service delivery-a national peri-operative guideline and WHO Surgical Safety Checklist implementation, and (8) Monitoring and evaluation-a comprehensive plan for short-term and long-term assessment of surgical quality and capacity. As Ethiopia progresses with its commitment to prioritize surgery within its Health Sector Transformation Plan, disseminating the process and outcomes of the SaLTS initiative will inform other countries on successful national implementation strategies. The following article describes the process by which the Ethiopian FMOH established surgical system reform and the preliminary results of implementation across these eight pillars.

The workforce is aging, and despite increasing numbers of anesthesiology residents, fewer graduates are entering the field of pediatrics. It should also be noted that fewer medical school graduates are entering pediatrics as well. This situation raises concerns about the availability of specialists and the training of future physicians. To address this shortage, a comprehensive strategy is urgently needed, including outreach, mentorship, financial incentives, and policy changes to attract and retain new talent in pediatric anesthesiology. Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent a severe impact on the availability and quality of pediatric anesthesia care.

%X Pediatric pain is a complex health challenge requiring a multi-modal management approach. It is critical that healthcare providers (HCPs) have access to ongoing, flexible education and mentorship specific to pediatric pain. However, there are significant gaps in available pain education and a need for more opportunities to support interprofessional training. Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is a model for delivering online HCP education and cultivating a virtual community of practice. Within the pediatric pain setting, ECHO® has potential to improve local access to specialized pain knowledge, particularly among the physicians, nurses, and allied health providers who primarily manage these cases in community and hospital settings across rural and urban environments. The purpose of this study was three-fold. First, to evaluate the feasibility (participation levels, acceptability) of implementing Project ECHO® in the context of pediatric pain. Second, to measure preliminary program impacts on HCP knowledge, self-efficacy, and clinical practice. Third, to characterize HCP program engagement levels before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A needs assessment was conducted to identify interprofessional education gaps and inform the program curriculum. The no-cost Pediatric ECHO® for Pain program offered TeleECHO sessions (didactic and case-based learning) as well as foundational education. Surveys were distributed at baseline and 6 months to assess outcomes using 7-point Likert scales. Participant engagement was assessed for periods prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted. Eighty-five TeleECHO sessions were hosted, with a mean attendance of 34.1 ± 23.4 HCPs. Acceptability scores at 6 months (n = 33) ranged from 5.0 ± 1.4 to 6.5 ± 0.5. Participants reported statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements in knowledge (7 out of 7 topics) and self-efficacy (8 out of 9 skills). Most participants reported positive practice impacts, including improved satisfaction with managing children with pain. Exploratory analyses showed a trend of greater engagement from ECHO® learners after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project ECHO® is a feasible and impactful model for virtual education of interprofessional HCPs in managing pediatric pain.

%X New graduate respiratory therapists (RTs), regardless of the degree program, receive limited preparation in neonatal/pediatric diseases and management. Experienced RTs typically have adult knowledge but limited exposure to pediatrics. We developed a program that included competence-based simulation to improve orientation success. A 9-week orientation program curriculum with simulation-based competence assessment was developed to ensure all new hires gained knowledge and skills to perform pediatric clinical tasks. Each new hire individually completed the same simulation scenarios during the first week and last week of orientation. Curriculum changes were made over time based on performance in simulations and on-the-job knowledge and skills during and after orientation. Paired and unpaired  From January 2017-February 2020, the program had 3 updates. Noninvasive ventilation and decompensating patient scenarios were completed for all periods. Ninety-two new staff were oriented in period 1 = 29 (new graduate RTs 20, experienced RTs 9); period 2 = 17 (new graduate RTs 10, experienced RTs 7); period 3 = 24 (new graduate RTs 21, experienced RTs 3), and period 4 = 22 (new graduate RTs = 22). Remediation during orientation occurred in 15% of the staff. Seventy-one percent successfully advanced to ICU orientation after completion of the program. All staff improved scores between pre- versus post-simulations in all periods: mean difference ± SD period 1: new graduate RTs 32.0 ± 17.0,  The use of a competence-based orientation program showed educational advancements and helped determine successful orientation completion.

%X To assess the experiences and attitudes of practicing anesthesiologists on practice/business management training received during residency and transitioning to practice through an online survey. An online survey, consisting of 39 questions developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Young Physicians, was emailed to 2 6551 practicing US anesthesiologists who were ASA members. Questions about individuals' demographic information, transition to practice (TTP) experiences, medical business training, and TTP curricula in residency were included. Results were reported as descriptive statistics. A total of 1199 responses were obtained (response rate 4.5%), and68% reported working in private practice over an average of 17 years. Those practicing ≤ 10 years were more likely to have a TTP curriculum in residency compared to those in practice ≥ 11 years. Common problems reported by many participants regarding TTP included: lack of effective mentorship, inadequate residency curricula/education, and an unfamiliarity with available resources. Although medical business practice education is now required by training programs, there is room for improvement in education. One potential solution is establishing TTP curricula in residency programs, which emphasize the business aspects of medicine and practice management, thus easing trainees from a training to practice environment.

%X Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices are commonly used for extracranial neuromodulation of drug-resistant epilepsy. These devices are implanted by multiple surgical subspecialties and managed by practitioners with varying levels of epilepsy-specific expertise. The North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) education committee presents a curriculum defining level-dependent recommendations within the six-core competency rubric for the implantation and management of VNS devices. A multidisciplinary (anesthesiology, neurology, neurosurgery, and physiatrists) and diverse (advanced practice providers, physicians, and surgeons) subcommittee of the NANS education committee met virtually over a year to develop a curriculum following the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies. The subcommittee used a consensus approach, evidence-based development strategy; once completed, the VNS curriculum was approved by the NANS board. The subcommittee developed a VNS curriculum as a standard to be used for implanting surgeons, managing physicians, and advanced practice providers. The vertical orientation of the curriculum uses the ACGME educational core competencies framework; within this paradigm is a horizontal progression of skills with distinct competency groups for implanting surgeons and/or managing physicians. The horizontal progression defines the expected competence for early learner, advanced learner, and independent practitioner. A NANS education subcommittee iteratively developed a VNS curriculum for defining progressive competence of myriad care providers, including clinicians and advanced practice providers, within the ACGME six core competencies.

%X The impact of an online postgraduate year (PGY-1) education program on anesthesiology resident knowledge base, anxiety, or preparedness has not been described previously. The literature shows resident knowledge of perioperative care is lower than expected. The Johns Hopkins Preoperative Evaluation and Anesthesia Course was designed as an 8 module, 8 month online academic curriculum for the program's PGY-1 class. Each module includes a pretest, topic synopsis, lecture video, moderated case discussion and a posttest. All PGY-1 residents entering the program in July 2012 were eligible to participate. Residents starting in July 2010 served as the control group. A survey was administered to measure self-assessed knowledge of and comfort with components of preoperative anesthesia care and perceived anxiety about starting the clinical anesthesia year. Additional outcome measures included performance on the pretest and postmodule tests and Anesthesia Knowledge Test scores from day 1 of Clinical Anesthesia year 1 (CA-1, PGY-2) orientation. Statistical analysis included independent t tests, the Mann-Whitney test, and sensitivity analyses. Residents in the intervention group showed an improvement of 16.25 to 39.60 percentage points between the pretest and posttest in each of the 8 subjects (P < .0001 in every subject). The intervention group median score was 24 percentile points higher on the Anesthesia Knowledge Test as compared with the control group (P = .0488; lower 95% CI, 9.92). Significant improvement was also seen across measures including comfort advising about medications (P < .0001), understanding of coexisting disease (P < .0001), comfort assessing patient airway (P = .0002), and anxiety about starting PGY-2 year (P = .0116). We have demonstrated significantly positive impact of a comprehensive, longitudinal online, asynchronous, multimodal educational intervention on PGY-1 residents using objective and subjective data.

%X The initial weeks of clinical anesthesiology are a formative period for new residents. Trainees may be clinically educated by a variety of individuals, and introductory didactic structure likely differs between institutions. This study was undertaken to define current orientation practices in US anesthesiology residency programs. A survey was created using Qualtrics© software and distributed to all US anesthesiology residency program directors through the Society of Academic Associations of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine email newsletter and through direct email to program directors. Fifty-six unique survey responses were received of 156 total programs. Eighty-nine percent of programs with an integrated intern year begin anesthesia-related orientation before the first year of clinical anesthesiology. Sixty-three percent of programs pair trainees with more than one specific individual during orientation. Programs most frequently pair trainees with anesthesiologists (75%) and/or senior residents (70%). Forty-six percent maintain this pairing for 4 weeks and 30% for 6 weeks or longer. Forty-three percent provide education on teaching practices to trainers. Introductory didactics last a median of 30 hours. Programs may blend lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, and/or checklists into a cohesive introductory curriculum. Fifty-six percent begin call responsibilities in the sixth week of orientation or later. Orientation practices for clinical anesthesia training vary across residency programs in the United States. We hope this information will help program directors compare their orientation practices to other programs and identify best practices and potentially useful variations.

%X To maintain compliance with the current shift towards competency-based milestone assessment in graduate medical education, residency training programs must reflect this emphasis in their curricula starting with the intern year of training.1 In working towards collaborative efforts in curricular development between Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) anesthesiology residency programs, understanding the structure and design of the clinical base year for anesthesiology residency programs nationwide will serve as a valuable initial step. Anonymous online surveys were sent to anesthesiology residency program directors to collect data regarding their program's anesthesiology clinical base year (CBY) required, elective, and novel rotations. The survey was also designed to characterize the educational resources provided by the department, changes in the design of the clinical base year, and the feedback received from interns or other rotation department heads. Thirty-nine out of 130 US anesthesiology residency program directors responded (30%). The majority of respondents (87%) provide an in-house categorical intern CBY with a majority of those (94%) including a month dedicated to anesthesiology, during which some form of mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff was provided. The majority of respondents with anesthesiology exposure stated that they provide educational resources such as textbook materials (82%) or simulation sessions (89%) to their residents. With the evolution of the role of the anesthesiologist, advancements in biotechnology, and newly created board examinations, it is imperative that the CBY prepares rising anesthesiology residents to meet these demands. Results from this survey study can serve as the initial step in improving the clinical base year structure for anesthesiology residents nationally. Collaborative efforts can be undertaken to better incorporate clinical competency, feedback mechanisms, and educational tools through the collection of experiential evidence of successful strategies as well as challenges faced by program directors nationwide.

%X Without highly qualified nurse anesthesia educators and administrators, the health care system will be threatened by the inadequate supply of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). American Association of Nurse Anesthesiologists' Faculty Stabilization Task Force (FSTF) analyzed reasons for high faculty turnover and developed recommendations to support nurse anesthesia faculty and administrators. A survey evaluated participants' current role, leadership development opportunities, mentorship experiences, and resource needs. Of 109 respondents, 87 (80%) were program administrators or assistant administrators with less than 5 years of experience in their role. Despite academic experience, 51% felt adequately prepared for their role. The FSTF provided 2 recommendations: to create a robust faculty development program for all faculty at all levels of CRNA education and a repository of information needed for program administrators and faculty to oversee and educate students in a high-quality CRNA program.

%X National Board of Anesthesiology (NBA) pass rate is an important and critical step in clinical residency programs. This study was designed to assess the relationship between an integrative educational intervention (IEI) and the relative annual pass rate (RAPR). RAPR is defined as ratio of NBA pass rate of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU) to the NBA pass rate of all the anesthesiology residency programs across Iran. In a descriptive-analytic retrospective study from 2012 to 2019, RAPR was calculated. IEI was implanted in the latter 4years period of this time interval includes: (1) individualized mentorship for residents by faculty members; (2) monthly in-training examination (ITE) in written; and (3) periodical mocked OSCE exam. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation between integrative educational intervention and RAPR results. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a statistically significant relationship between "integrative educational intervention program" and the RAPR results: Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.655 (P value = 0.039). The IEI package of Anesthesiology Department, SBMU showed a significant relationship with improvements in successfulness for anesthesiology residents in the National Board Exam (RAPR trend). More prolonged studies could prevail further aspects of these interventions.

%X Mentorship plays a vital role in pain medicine, guiding professionals from medical training through independent practice. This article explores how mentorship fosters research, enhances clinical competence, and promotes multidisciplinary collaboration. Drawing on insights from leading institutions, we propose a structured mentorship framework tailored to different career stages. Effective mentorship cultivates research skills, expands academic networks, and provides early exposure to the field, shaping long-term career trajectories. It also strengthens clinical expertise, encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration, and advances diversity, equity, and inclusion in medicine. Structured academic mentorship models offer longitudinal guidance for sustained professional development. By aligning mentor-mentee goals and ensuring consistent support, mentorship programs maximize professional growth and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This article outlines key strategies and tools for building effective mentorship programs, emphasizing their transformative impact on the field of pain medicine.

%X To facilitate various transitions of medical residents, healthcare team members and departments may employ various organizational socialization strategies, including formal and informal onboarding methods. However, residents' preferences for these organizational socialization strategies to ease their transition can vary. This study identifies patterns (viewpoints) in these preferences. Using Q-methodology, we asked a purposeful sample of early-career residents to rank a set of statements into a quasi-normal distributed grid. Statements were based on previous qualitative interviews and organizational socialization theory. Participants responded to the question, 'What are your preferences regarding strategies other health care professionals, departments, or hospitals should use to optimize your next transition?' Participants then explained their sorting choices in a post-sort questionnaire. We identified different viewpoints based on by-person (inverted) factor analysis and Varimax rotation. We interpreted the viewpoints using distinguishing and consensus statements, enriched by residents' comments. Fifty-one residents ranked 42 statements, among whom 36 residents displayed four distinct viewpoints: Dependent residents (n = 10) favored a task-oriented approach, clear guidance, and formal colleague relationships; Social Capitalizing residents (n = 9) preferred structure in the onboarding period and informal workplace social interactions; Autonomous residents (n = 12) prioritized a loosely structured onboarding period, independence, responsibility, and informal social interactions; and Development-oriented residents (n = 5) desired a balanced onboarding period that allowed independence, exploration, and development. This identification of four viewpoints highlights the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all approaches to resident transition. Healthcare professionals and departments should tailor their socialization strategies to residents' preferences for support, structure, and formal/informal social interaction.

%X In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, anesthesiologists are the second largest group of physicians in hospitals, but this does not correspond to the amount of anesthesiology teaching that medical students receive in medical schools. Accordingly, the chances of medical students recognizing anesthesiology as a promising personal professional career are smaller than in other disciplines with large teaching components. Subsequent difficulties to recruit anesthesiology residents are likely, although many reasons support anesthesiology as a professional career.Traditional strategies to teach medical students in anesthesiology in medical school consist of airway management or cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts in manikins. Anesthesiology is a complex interaction consisting of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, clinical evaluation, experience, knowledge, and manual skills. While some medical schools offer teaching in high fidelity simulators, clinical teaching in the operating room is often limited. When medical students opt for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology, there is a chance to demonstrate the fascinating world of anesthesiology, but this chance has to be utilized carefully by anesthesiologists, as young talents have to be discovered, supported, and challenged.We have put together a short guide for medical students for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology in adults in order to generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology as well as a sense of achievement. Basic knowledge about premedication, induction, maintenance and strategies for anesthesia is discussed. Further, the most important anesthesia drugs are discussed and manual skills, such as intravenous cannulation, mask ventilation, intubation, and regional anesthesia are featured with QR-code based video illustrations on a smartphone or personal computer. We did not discuss possible local mannerism and special patient groups (e. g., children, special medical history), local guidelines, or standard operating procedures.Medical students can be inspired by anesthesiology when not simply told about the tools of the trade and strategies, but instead by gaining knowledge and clinical skills that render a sense of achievement, likely during a clinical rotation into anesthesiology. A short theoretical instruction of anesthesiology enables rapid and targeted orientation even before a clinical rotation. Whether this subsequently results in a higher recruiting chance is currently unknown.

%X Promoting and retaining junior faculty are major challenges for many medical schools. High clinical workloads often limit time for scholarly projects and academic development, especially in anesthesiology. To address this, we created the East/West Visiting Scholars in Pediatric Anesthesia Program (ViSiPAP). The program's goal is to help "jumpstart" academic careers by providing opportunities for national exposure and recognition through invited lectures and collaborative opportunities. East/West ViSiPAP benefits the participating scholars, the home and hosting anesthesia departments, and pediatric anesthesia fellowship training programs. By fostering a sense of well-being and inclusion in the pediatric anesthesia community, East/West ViSiPAP has the potential to increase job satisfaction, help faculty attain promotion, and reduce attrition. Faculty and trainees are exposed to new expertise and role models. Moreover, ViSiPAP provides opportunities for women and underrepresented in medicine faculty. This program can help develop today's junior faculty into tomorrow's leaders in pediatric anesthesia. We advocate for expanding the concept of ViSiPAP to other institutions in academic medicine.

%X Although mentoring has been accepted as an effective and nourishing component in medical learning, known mentoring programs for the residents are lacking in most countries. To evaluate the mentoring program for anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University, an examination was designed to explore the styles of mentoring programs, as well as the aims and outcome followed by such programs. In October 2016, Anesthesiology Department of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences enrolled all the nine educational wards in "mentorship program". Twelve members of the faculty were chosen to be mentor. This program contained: (a) Creating online groups for reporting, feedbacks, and problem-solving, (b) integrating each chapter of textbooks for studying program each month, (c) establishing formative and summative assessments (i.e., PMP, OSCE, multiple choice exams), (d) role-playing for stress management of level 4 residents. Our main objective was to provide the residents with the provision of mentors. The goals of our programs were: Arrange a safe environment to encourage and foster reflection, promote self-care and wellness, guide special development, provide a resource for residents pursuing control, enrich team constructing and problem-solving skills, and promotion in career counseling of anesthesia residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences enrolled in this program from 2014 to 2017. We retrospectively compared 2 periods before (2014 - 2015) and after (2016 - 2017) of monthly examination and educational conference. In the academic stage from 2014 - 2015, the overall first-time license rate for the IBA written QE was 7 of 14 (50%) and in the period of 2016 - 2017, the general rate was 11 of 14 (78%) and in the period of 2017 - 2018, it was 12 of 14 (85%). For each extra year experiencing the program, the odds ratio for passing IBA written QE was 1.7 (P < 0.05). The median Iranian Board of Anesthesiology In-Training Examination (IBAITE) percentile was considerably greater in period 2 than period 1 (P < 0.05). Also, there was a significant correlation between IBAITE score and first-time passing rates for the IBA written QE (0.55, P < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrated the clinical mentorship program as an effective method in improving theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents. Programmed mentorship could significantly improve the educational goal achievements for anesthesiology residents. Mentoring programs are needed to be more used; however, need to be assessed and evaluated, especially regarding the professional aspects of education. Medical schools could subsequently be assessed regarding the number and quality of their running mentorship programs as a quality improvement tool.

%X There is an urgent need to train more anesthesia providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is also a need to provide more educational opportunities in subspecialty areas of anesthetic practice such as trauma management, pain management, obstetric anesthesia, and pediatric anesthesia. Together, these subspecialty areas make up a large proportion of the clinical workload in LMICs. In these countries, the quality of education may be variable, there may be few teachers, and opportunities for continued learning and mentorship are rare. Short subspecialty courses such as Primary Trauma Care, Essential Pain Management, Safer Anaesthesia From Education-Obstetric Anaesthesia, and Safer Anaesthesia From Education-Paediatric Anaesthesia have been developed to help fill this need. They have the potential for immediate impact by providing an opportunity for continuing professional development and relevant subspecialty training. These courses are all short (1-3 days), are presented as an off-the-shelf package, and include a teach-the-teacher component. They use a variety of interactive teaching techniques and are designed to be adaptable and responsive to local needs. There is an emphasis on local ownership of the educational process that helps to promote sustainability. After an initial financial outlay to purchase equipment, the costs are relatively low. Short subspecialty courses appear to be part of the educational answer in LMICs, but there is a need for research to validate their role.

%X We describe the need for an anesthesiology resident wellness program (ARWP) and the challenges associated with its development and implementation. We also present the results of a preliminary program evaluation. We conducted a needs assessment of Canadian anesthesiology residency programs for a formal ARWP. This endeavor involved both a cross-sectional survey and a focus group of Canadian anesthesiology residency training program directors (PDs). Following the development and implementation of an ARWP at our own university, we conducted an evaluation. The quantitative data are reported using descriptive statistics. Common themes were generated from qualitative data through an iterative process. Among the 18 PDs across Canada, 10 (56%) responded to the needs assessment. The PDs identified that resident wellness was important to the delivery of their programs but that very few had a formal wellness curriculum. This informed the further development of the ARWP over two years to comprise a Modular Curriculum, a Peer Support Curriculum, Self-Directed Learning Activities, and a Department Wellness Program. Online evaluation of the ARWP was completed by 28 of 31 (90%) of our anesthesiology residents, who reported high levels of satisfaction with the ARWP, the relevance of the topics, and the applicability of skills and information to both work and daily life. Respondents identified Team Building Activities, Mentorship and Orientation, Resident Wellness Nights, and Transitions to Practice Night as the most valuable components of the ARWP. After identifying the need for a formal ARWP in Canada, we implemented one at the University of Saskatchewan. We found high levels of overall resident satisfaction with the program.

%X Chronic pain affects approximately one in every five Canadians and has a substantial impact on psychological well-being, relationships, ability to attend work or school, and overall functioning.The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic introduced orientation sessions, with the aim of providing new patients with pain education to help prepare patients for engagement with multimodal pain management strategies. This report summarizes the results of a formative evaluation of the orientation session at The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic to determine whether patients perceived the orientation session as beneficial. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and then thematically analyzed to understand patients' perspectives on the orientation session. Coding was done by two team members using the constant comparison analyses method with key ideas, concepts, and patterns identified and compared to identify similarities. Between September 6 and October 18, 2019, 18 patients attended an orientation session and 12 consented to participation and completed telephone interviews. The six themes identified included (1) feeling of community, (2) participants feeling heard by providers, (3) appreciation of the holistic approach, (4) availability of community resources, (5) barriers to access, and (6) discordant feelings of preparedness for the physician appointment. Results from this evaluation indicate that the orientation session offered at The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic improves chronic pain literacy, reduces feeling of isolation, and instills hope. As such, it appears to be a valuable component of pain clinic programs.

%X The stresses of starting a new job can make anyone feel tired and inefficient. In health care, this may impair the ability to learn at a time when there is most to learn, and increase the risk of error in a context where errors may lead to patient harm. The aim of this study was to understand issues which influence anesthesia trainees' transition to a pediatric setting. This qualitative study utilized in-depth semi-structured interviews to gather data from 31 anesthesia trainees who had commenced work at a tertiary children's hospital between 4 and 6 weeks previously. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Two key themes were identified: feeling ineffective, which appeared to have both a cognitive component (feeling disoriented) and an emotional component (feeling useless), and feeling anxious or afraid. Trainees found the pediatric environment highly unfamiliar, which made them feel disoriented, inefficient, and at times incompetent. Many experienced difficulty identifying a useful role in a highly specialized area of practice, leading to loss of identity as an expert clinician. Many described an ever-present fear of making an anesthetic error or being unable to manage a rapidly evolving clinical situation. Some trainees developed a negative mindset, which was reinforced by subsequent perceived failures. Overall, these experiences impeded trainees' ability to concentrate and learn. The impact of disorientation and anxiety on anesthesia trainees as they adapt to a highly specialized clinical environment such as a children's hospital should not be underestimated. Study findings illustrate the importance of helping new trainees to feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in assessing their own performance during the transition period.

%X As a step toward understanding whether learning preferences may benefit trainees and instructors, we studied the learning preferences, based on the VARK questionnaire, of anesthesiology residents during their orientation month to determine whether knowing their preferences influenced the educational resources they used. While resource utilization was similar for residents who knew their preferences and those who did not, residents overall used aural and read/write resources frequently. The learning preferences of 13 residents (72.2%) changed during the month. While further research is needed, this study provides insight into anesthesiology residents' learning styles.
