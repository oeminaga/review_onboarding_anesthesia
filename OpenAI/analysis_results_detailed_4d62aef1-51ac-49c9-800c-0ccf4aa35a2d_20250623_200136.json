    "summary": "The study qualitatively evaluated the first iteration of the Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course, a blended SORT-IT model, delivered to anesthesiology residents in Kigali. Using semi-structured interviews with 12 participants (6 students, 4 primary mentors, 2 secondary mentors), two independent coders identified facilitators and barriers. Key facilitators included structured milestones and mentorship, while barriers were limited time, mentor availability, background knowledge gaps, and infrastructure challenges. Cultural hierarchy played a minor role. The authors propose enhancing mentor training, adjusting timelines, and improving support for future iterations and similar programs.",

    "summary": "This study surveyed 131 ACGME-accredited anesthesiology residency program directors in the US (34% response) to assess the prevalence and characteristics of formal mentorship programs. Of respondents, 88% reported a formal mentorship program, with variability in mentor-mentee pairing methods and meeting frequency. Few programs provided faculty mentor training (37%) or evaluated program effectiveness (16\u201321%). Program directors highly value mentorship for career planning, professionalism, and work\u2013life balance but note gaps in structure, training, and evaluation. The authors call for resident-centered research and systematic program assessments to optimize mentorship models.",
