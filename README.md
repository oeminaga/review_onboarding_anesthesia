- `file`: PDF document
- `system_prompt`: AI system instructions
- `user_prompt`: Analysis instructions
- `model`: AI model to use

Update the `API_URL` variable in the code to match your API endpoint.

## Database Schema

The application creates three main tables:
- `criteria`: Evaluation criteria definitions
- `prompt_templates`: Reusable prompt templates
- `reviews`: Analysis results and metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all required packages are installed
   - Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if available

2. **Database Issues**
   - Delete `review_system.db` to reset the database
   - Check file permissions in the application directory

3. **API Connection**
   - Verify the API endpoint is running
   - Check network connectivity
   - Update `API_URL` if needed

4. **Performance Issues**
   - For large documents, increase timeout values
   - Consider using "Quick" analysis depth for faster processing
