Barriers to undergraduate medical students' research engagement in Pakistan: a qualitative exploration.,"Engaging in research is a critical component of medical education, fostering critical thinking and evidence-based practices. Despite its importance, undergraduate medical students in Pakistan face significant barriers to research engagement. This study explores the challenges hindering their participation in research activities. A qualitative research design was employed, utilizing semi-structured interviews with 45 undergraduate medical and dental students from a public medical university in Pakistan. Participants were purposefully selected to provide diverse perspectives. Data were analyzed thematically to identify recurring barriers and challenges. Four key themes emerged: (1) Time constraints, as academic workloads and clinical rotations left limited time for research; (2) Lack of extrinsic motivation, knowledge, and research ability, including insufficient training and limited institutional incentives; (3) Inadequate financial assistance and poor maintenance of research facilities, with students highlighting a lack of funding and outdated infrastructure; and (4) Lack of support from research mentors and training, emphasizing the need for effective mentorship and structured research programs. These barriers collectively hinder students' ability to engage meaningfully in research. The study highlights the urgent need for systemic reforms in medical education, including integrating research training into curricula, improving mentorship programs, providing financial and infrastructural support, and incentivizing research participation. Addressing these challenges can foster a culture of inquiry, empowering students to contribute to advancements in medical science.","Mahmood Amir, Rehman Nadia, Huang Xiao, Riaz Irfan",BMC medical education,2025,40269854,PMC12016454,10.1186/s12909-025-07185-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40269854,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12016454,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Intrinsic Motivation, Attitudes, and Practices of Young Physicians Regarding Scientific Research: Cross-Sectional Study in China.","Recent decades have witnessed a concerning global trend of declining engagement among physician scientists, with participation rates falling from 4.7% in the 1980s to approximately 1.5% today in the United States. The research highlights the declining engagement of physician scientists and the challenges young physicians face in participating in clinical research. This study aims to examine the intrinsic motivation, attitudes, and practices of young physicians toward scientific research and its clinical value and identify factors that influence their engagement in research activities. We developed a comprehensive questionnaire measuring intrinsic motivation (27 items; score range 27-135), attitudes (8 items; score range 8-40), and practices (7 items; score range 7-35) related to scientific research among physicians. Cronbach α coefficients for the 3 dimensions were 0.967, 0.916, and 0.937, respectively. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on young physicians from 12 hospitals in eastern provinces of China between May 2024 and October 2024. A total of 532 valid questionnaires were obtained. Among the respondents, 271 (50.9%) were female, and 317 (59.6%) had not led or been deeply involved in a research project. Most physicians (more than 80%) reported high intrinsic motivation and positive attitudes, but relatively fewer demonstrated active research practices. Key challenges identified included balancing research with clinical work (n=102, 19.2%) disagreed that research alleviates clinical monotony) and insufficient institutional support (n=329, 61.3%) reported inadequate research investment from their hospitals). The mean scores for intrinsic motivation, attitude, and practice were 108.79 (SD 11.91; possible range: 27-135), 32.23 (SD 4.27; possible range: 8-40), and 27.44 (SD 3.81; possible range: 7-35), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that intrinsic motivation score (odds ratio [OR] 1.063, 95% CI 1.035-1.091), attitude score (OR 1.095, 95% CI 1.029-1.165), and good research atmosphere (OR 1.915, 95% CI 1.038-3.533) were independently associated with practice. Moreover, structural equation modeling analysis revealed that intrinsic motivation had a direct effect on attitude (β=0.854; P<.001), attitude directly affected practice (β=0.637; P<.001), and intrinsic motivation indirectly influenced practice through attitude (β=0.544; P<.001). Despite high levels of intrinsic motivation and positive attitudes toward research, young physicians face significant barriers to active research engagement. Our findings suggest that fostering a supportive research environment is a critical factor that can help translate motivation into practice. Young physicians exhibited positive intrinsic motivation and attitudes but relatively inactive practices toward scientific research and its clinical application. Institutional initiatives should focus on providing protected research time, formal mentorship programs, and adequate research infrastructure to leverage young physicians' existing motivation. Addressing the gap between motivation and practice could significantly contribute to reversing the declining trend of physician scientists and enhancing evidence-based medicine implementation.","Wang Liwei, Ren Jiajia, Zhang Song, Sun Yu'e, Ding Yu, Yang Congxian, Zheng Chan, Shi Zhenduo, Zhu Yangzi",Journal of medical Internet research,2025,40262128,,10.2196/72633,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40262128,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Randomized Comparison of Oblique versus Transverse Orientation for Ultrasound-Guided Internal Jugular Venous Cannulation in Pediatric Heart Surgery Patients.,Ultrasound-guided internal jugular venous access improves the rate of successful cannulation of the internal jugular vein in both adult and pediatric patients. Internal jugular venous cannulation in pediatric patients is anatomically and technically more challenging than in adults. The oblique method is a novel approach for guiding central venous cannulation. There is currently a scarcity of research on central venous cannulation techniques for pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the success rates between the oblique and transverse approach of jugular venous cannulation in pediatric cardiac surgery patients. A prospective randomized clinical trial of pediatric patients who underwent cardiac surgery at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital was conducted between February and May 2021. Sixty patients were randomized into two groups: 30 in the oblique group and 30 in the transverse group. There was no difference in the first needle pass success rate between the oblique and transversal approaches (86.7% vs. 73.3%; P = 0.19). There is no difference in the total number of attempts between the two groups (1.3 vs 1.43; P > 0.05). There was no difference between oblique and transverse orientations for internal jugular venous cannulation in pediatric cardiac surgery patients in terms of successful cannulation on the first needle pass and total number of attempts.,"Heriwardito Aldy, Manggala Sidharta K, Christina Angela",Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,2025,40237661,,10.4103/aca.aca_167_24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40237661,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Strengthening trauma resuscitation education and training in low-resource settings: A call for global inclusion.,"Trauma is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide, disproportionately affecting low-resource settings where access to specialized care is limited. Systemic barriers, including fragmented trauma networks and workforce shortages, contribute to poor outcomes. Strengthening trauma resuscitation through structured education and training is critical to improving survival and reducing disparities. However, traditional trauma training models often fail to address regional constraints, limiting their effectiveness. Brazil has developed a comprehensive trauma resuscitation education model by integrating public awareness campaigns, medical student-led initiatives, digital learning, simulation-based training, and telemedical support. A horizontal approach to trauma patient management, combined with hands-on immersive simulation training, has further enhanced this framework, emphasizing the team approach and non-technical skills essential for high-performance trauma care. This narrative review examines Brazil's trauma resuscitation training strategies and explores their potential to serve as a template for low-resource settings. By analyzing key educational components, we identify cost-effective solutions to strengthen trauma system capacity. To bridge disparities, trauma education must extend beyond well-resourced environments. Faculty development, sustainable mentorship, and access to technology-driven education are critical to equipping providers with the skills needed to manage complex trauma scenarios. Mobile simulation units and telemedicine platforms expand training to remote regions, while scalable digital platforms enable real-time collaboration. Despite these advancements, funding constraints, logistical barriers, and the need for culturally tailored education hinder widespread implementation. Embedding trauma education into national health policies and disaster response systems is essential to ensuring sustainable, high-quality trauma care worldwide.","Lulic Ileana, Mesquita Carlos, Lulic Dinka, Simões Romeo Lages, Ferreira Luís, Koleda Piotr, Baptista Sérgio, Alexandrino Henrique, Calderan Thiago Rodrigues, Carvalho Vanessa Henriques, Kruger Vitor Favali, Belem Rodrigo Caselli, López-Mozos Fernando, Yanez Carlos, Saric Jadranka Pavicic, Fraga Gustavo Pereira",Resuscitation plus,2025,40235927,PMC11999482,10.1016/j.resplu.2025.100935,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40235927,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11999482,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effect of Intravenous Anesthesia With Remimazolam Besylate on Hemodynamics and Neuroprotection in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Craniocerebral Injury.,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam besylate on hemodynamics and neuroprotection in patients undergoing surgery for craniocerebral injury. This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data from 92 patients with craniocerebral injury who underwent craniotomy at Peking University International Hospital between May 2021 and August 2023. Based on anesthesia method applied, patients were divided into the observation group (n = 49) and the conventional group (n = 43). The conventional group underwent conventional anesthesia, and the observation group received intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam besylate. All patients were followed up for 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, perioperative hemodynamic indicators and neurological function were compared between the two groups at different time points, such as T0 (before surgery), T1 (30 minutes after anesthesia), T2 (at the end of surgery), and T3 (24 hours post-surgery). Additionally, perioperative indicators, postoperative adverse reactions, and prognosis were statistically analyzed. From T0 to T1, heart rate (HR), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) showed an increasing trend in both groups. Afterwards, HR and MAP demonstrated a decreasing trend in both groups, and ultimately restoring to T0 level. However, SpO<sub>2</sub> remained stable and then decreased slightly. The differences in HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and MAP levels between the two groups and across different time points were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At T3, the levels of Tau protein, neuron-specific enolase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were lower in the observation group than in the conventional group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the observation group demonstrated shorter spontaneous breathing recovery time, eye-opening time, orientation recovery time, extubation time, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and total hospital stay than the conventional group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the incidence rates of arrhythmia and pulmonary infection were lower in the observation group than in the conventional group (p < 0.05). Similarly, the observation group exhibited a better overall prognosis than the conventional group (p < 0.05). Intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam besylate in patients undergoing surgery for craniocerebral injury can maintain stable hemodynamics, protect neurological function, and promote post-surgery recovery.","Li Hongpei, Liu Kunpeng, Li Hao, Gu Juanjuan, Yao Lan",Annali italiani di chirurgia,2025,40234226,,10.62713/aic.3867,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40234226,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Single versus two-level superficial parasternal intercostal plane block: cadaveric evaluation of injectate spread with needle tip position on anterior surface of costal cartilage.,"Superficial parasternal intercostal plane blocks have grown in clinical use for cardiac surgery as a targeted fascial plane block for median sternotomy. Despite this, there remains no consensus on technique for optimal parasternal spread of injectate. The primary objective of this cadaveric study was to evaluate parasternal spread of injectate of single versus two-level superficial parasternal intercostal plane injections with the needle tip positioned on the anterior surface of the costal cartilage. We performed 10 single-level injections at T4 and 10 two-level injections at T3 and T5 on alternating sides in 10 fresh frozen cadavers. All injections were ultrasound guided with a parasagittal ultrasound probe orientation and an in-plane needle orientation. Anatomic dissections were performed immediately following injections. Parasternal spread of injectate was greater with two-level injections at T3 and T5 costal cartilages than with single-level injections at the T4 costal cartilage, with two-level injections consistently spreading to the T2-T5 intercostal spaces. Median (Q1, Q3) intercostal space spread for single-level injections was 2.0 (2.0-2.5). Median (Q1, Q3) intercostal space spread for two-level injections was 4.0 (4.0-4.375). Two-level injections with the needle tip located on the anterior surface of the costal cartilage resulted in improved parasternal spread compared with single-level injections.","Christensen Jon, Ritter Matthew, Douglas Rachel, Kattil Punnose, Lachman Nirusha, Mauermann William J",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,2025,40194831,,10.1136/rapm-2025-106488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40194831,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Women Physicians in Leadership Roles in Critical Care Medicine or Academic Medicine-A Systematic Literature Review.,"To systematically review and synthesize the evidence surrounding factors impacting women rising to leadership positions in critical care medicine (CCM). PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 2011 to 2024. Articles included were cohort studies, surveys, and interviews addressing women physicians practicing in CCM and related fields of academic medicine. Causes of not rising to leadership among women were extracted and tabulated along with other pertinent study characteristics. The database searches generated 892 records. Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria for data extraction. The included articles represented seven countries, with 30 studies originating in the United States. Only two studies were from CCM, whereas others addressed leadership in other academic and clinical fields of medicine, medical journals, and societies and medical faculty. Twenty-six studies were qualitative, observational studies; five were survey based and eight included interviews. Using thematic analysis, the following five domains emerged: pipeline issues, lack of opportunities, lack of self-efficacy, lack of mentorship, and sustaining women in leadership. While the satisfaction rates of women in CCM were high, challenges remain for women to obtain leadership opportunities. A culture of support could better nurture and sustain women in leadership roles. More CCM-focused gender bias research is needed. Future targets for interventions include gender bias training, awareness, and developing strategies to break through the cycle of gender preferential promotions in CCM.","Siddiqui Shahla, Gali Bhargavi, Cotter Elizabeth, Short Margo, McNichol Megan, Mulaikal Teresa A, Cassavaugh Jessica, Chow Jarva, Russell Cortessa, Golhar Shweta Y, Ben-Jacob Talia K",Critical care explorations,2025,40153554,PMC11957621,10.1097/CCE.0000000000001249,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40153554,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11957621,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Student Mentorship Pathways Within Physician Assistant/Associate Training Programs: A National Survey.,"Early training and career mentorship has many notable benefits for health care professionals. Little is known about student mentorship pathways within physician assistant/associate (PA) training programs. Using an Internet-based questionnaire, the authors surveyed 332 PA programs from May 7 to June 10, 2024. Survey items addressed informal and formal student mentoring pathways. The response rate was 96 of 322 (30%). Overall, 40 of 96 (42%) PA programs reported having formal student mentoring pathways. Taking into account for participant drop off, of programs completing the informal mentoring section of the survey, 36 of 74 (49%) had informal student mentoring pathways. A total of 8 programs reported having both student pathways. There were differences in the primary objectives for formal and informal student mentoring pathways. Both student mentoring pathways were designed to support established learning outcomes, followed by supporting formal PA program goals. Less than half of PA programs report having student mentorship pathways. Even fewer PA programs have student mentorship pathways with formal structure, curriculum, or outcome measures.","Louwagie Victoria S, Strelow Brittany A, Jenkins Sarah M, Huang Jeffrey, Billings Heather, Cook David A",The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,2025,40079552,,10.1097/JPA.0000000000000660,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40079552,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Comparison of the Learning Curves of Ultrasound-Guided In-Plane Needle Placement Among Four Different Puncture Modes: A Randomized, Crossover, Simulation Study.","The effects of different positional relationships between the probe, needle, and puncture model on in-plane puncture performance have not been fully evaluated. In this simulation study, we used a 4-period crossover design to compare the learning curves of ultrasound-guided in-plane needle placement among 4 different puncture modes by novices. Forty residents were randomly assigned to receive training in one of 4 puncture modes according to the placement of the puncture model and the orientation of the probe to the operator: horizontal phantom-parallel probe (HP), horizontal phantom-vertical probe (HV), vertical phantom-parallel probe (VP), and vertical phantom-vertical probe (VV). They were allowed 10 trials on each mode and then received the other 3 trainings following the predefined sequences based on a Williams design. Puncture time was recorded from needle entry until successful in-plane puncture under ultrasound guidance. Linear and generalized linear models indicated significant effects of puncture mode and trial number on puncture time (P < .001 for all models). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) puncture times for 10 trials were 44 (44) s for HP, 37 (34) s for HV, 80 (57) s for VP, and 46 (48) s for VV. HV had the shortest puncture time, while VP had the longest. No significant difference was observed in puncture time between VV and HP modes (P = .330). Within each mode, puncture time significantly decreased from the first to the tenth trial (P = .001 for HP, P < .001 for HV, P < .001 for VP, and P = .002 for VV). VP showed the steepest learning curve; however, even after 10 trials, its puncture time remained significantly higher than that of the other 3 modes (P < .001 for all comparisons). Ultrasound-guided in-plane puncture difficulty follows the order VP > HP = VV > HV.","Hu Yingjie, Xiao Jing, He Xiao, Qin Tingting, Wan Li, Yao Wenlong",Anesthesia and analgesia,2025,40048379,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000007459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40048379,,TRUE,Simulation-based training comparing four different ultrasound-guided in-plane needle placement techniques,Novice anesthesiology residents,Improved proficiency in ultrasound-guided needle placement with identification of optimal technique (horizontal phantom-vertical probe had shortest puncture time),FALSE,,,
Comparison of desflurane and sevoflurane as maintenance inhalational anaesthetic agents for adult patients undergoing neurosurgeries: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.,"Despite its superior blood-gas partition coefficient compared to sevoflurane, use of desflurane in neurosurgery is limited due to concerns about cerebral vasodilation and potential adverse haemodynamic effects. This study aims to systematically evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of desflurane and sevoflurane in neurosurgical procedures. A search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Europe PMC and Medline databases for articles published until 5 November 2024 using a combination of pertinent keywords. This review includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that analyse the comparison between desflurane and sevoflurane in neurosurgery. The risk of bias from each RCT was assessed using the Risk of Bias version 2 tool from Cochrane Collaboration. We utilised random-effects models to evaluate the mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) for the outcomes presented. Fourteen trials, encompassing 904 patients, were included in the analysis. Our analysis revealed significantly faster recovery profiles with desflurane, including reduced emergence time [MD -2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.99, -1.52, <i>P</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 71%], extubation time (MD -3.02; 95% CI: -3.89, -2.15, <i>P</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 79%) and overall recovery time (MD -3.26; 95% CI: -5.01, -1.51, <i>P</i> = 0.0003, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 83%), compared to sevoflurane. Desflurane was associated with better postoperative cognitive function, as evidenced by higher short orientation memory concentration test scores - a measure of attention and memory - at 15 min (MD: 2.26; 95% CI: 0.13, 4.39, <i>P</i> = 0.04, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 91%) and 60 min (MD: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.50, <i>P</i> = 0.005, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%) after extubation. We did not find any significant difference in the intra- and/or postoperative events, such as emergence agitation, nausea and vomiting, shivering, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, pain and convulsions, between the two groups of intervention. This study suggests that desflurane anaesthesia offers faster recovery with a similar safety profile to sevoflurane for neurosurgery.","Hariyanto Hori, Widiastuti Monika, Pandrya Carla Oktaviani, Surya Kevin Anderson, Audi William",Indian journal of anaesthesia,2025,40046703,PMC11878358,10.4103/ija.ija_1215_24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40046703,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11878358,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Altered white matter microstructural integrity in patients with postherpetic neuralgia: a combined DTI and DTI-NODDI study.,"Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a debilitating condition resulting from herpes zoster infection, characterized by persistent pain that significantly impacts quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the white matter microstructural alterations associated with PHN and to assess the relationship between diffusion metrics and clinical symptoms. A total of 29 patients with PHN, 28 patients recovering from herpes zoster (RHZ), and 27 healthy controls (HC) were recruited, and clinical assessments were obtained to evaluate pain intensity and psychological distress. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data was collected, followed by analysis of diffusion and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) metrics. Statistical analyses included ANOVA to compare groups and Pearson correlation coefficients to assess relationships between imaging metrics and clinical outcomes. PHN patients exhibited significantly altered white matter integrity, specifically in neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index, compared to both RHZ patients and HC. Significant correlations were also found between altered imaging metrics and clinical assessments of pain and emotional distress, with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and NDI associated with higher pain scores and psychological symptoms. Our study highlights significant microstructural changes in white matter tracts in patients with PHN, indicating compromised neural integrity that correlates with increased pain perception and emotional distress. NODDI demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting these alterations compared to traditional DTI metrics, underscoring its potential for enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in managing chronic pain conditions like PHN.","Qian Wei, Xu Xiaopei, Wu Ying, Yu Lina, Wang Chao, Yan Min, Yu Risheng",Frontiers in neuroscience,2025,40040848,PMC11876147,10.3389/fnins.2025.1552961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40040848,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11876147,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Associations of abusive supervision among collegiate athletes from equity-deserving groups.,"To examine differences in abusive/supportive coach supervision experienced by collegiate athletes across race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and disability; determine the impact of coach characteristics on abusive supervision prevalence; and explore outcomes related to team culture, athlete autonomy, perceived coach leadership skills and perceived concern for athletes' well-being. Cross-sectional analysis of the 2021-2022 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) myPlaybook survey on 3317 athletes (aged ≥18 years). The survey captured self-reported demographics, sport type (team vs individual, lean vs non-lean) and multiple validated measures reflecting abusive/supportive coaching styles. Structural equation modelling identified associations while controlling for confounders. Overall, 18.6% (n=618) of athletes reported some form of abusive supervision. After adjusting for covariates, participating in team sport (OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) and having a disability (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31) were associated with higher odds of reporting abusive supervision. No significant differences were found based on athlete race/ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation. Coaches demonstrating attentiveness to athletes' needs (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92) and respect for their input (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00) had lower odds of reported abusive supervision. Nearly one-fifth of this NCAA cohort experienced abusive coach supervision. Disability and team sport participation were significantly associated with increased reports, whereas race/ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation showed no significant differences. In disabled and team sport athletes, sustained verbal/non-verbal abuse had a negative impact on athletes' perception of team culture, autonomy, coaches' leadership skills and coaches' concern for their well-being. Coaching and leadership styles remain critical educational targets for providing safe sport environments for all athletes.","Runquist Edward B, Adenaiye Oluwasanmi O, Sarzaeim Mojdeh, Milroy Jeffery, Wyrick David, Tuakli-Wosornu Yetsa A",British journal of sports medicine,2025,40032295,,10.1136/bjsports-2024-108282,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40032295,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"The Co-Pilot Project in wartime: lessons from Lviv, Ukraine.","The ongoing war in Ukraine has introduced many challenges to an already overburdened and resource-limited medical system. Longitudinal collaborations, material support, educational outreach, and surgical mentorship are essential for improving outcomes and standards of neurosurgical care in extreme settings such as in times of war.

The Current State of Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesiology Staffing in the United States.,"The population of patients with congenital heart disease has grown, but the supply of pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists has not kept pace. The Pediatric Anesthesia Leadership Council (PALC) and the Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society (CCAS) formed a task force to evaluate the current state of the specialty of pediatric cardiac anesthesia, including staffing, work environment, education, compensation, and career development. Five task force working groups developed survey questions that explored 5 different aspects of a pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist's career. Surveys were completed by CCAS member faculty volunteers, division chiefs/directors of pediatric cardiac anesthesia programs, program directors of pediatric cardiac anesthesia fellowships, and fellowship graduates from the past 10 years. Survey completion rates were 77% (n = 86) for CCAS faculty, 52% (n = 58) for pediatric cardiac anesthesiology directors/division chiefs, 91% (n = 21) for pediatric cardiac anesthesiology fellowship directors, and 53% (n = 65) for 2013-2022 pediatric cardiac anesthesia fellowship graduates. Of CCAS faculty respondents, 31.4% (n = 27) are considering leaving pediatric cardiac anesthesia for a less stressful field. While most respondents reported being involved in academic activities, 34% (n = 29) do not receive nonclinical time. Only 35.3% (n = 30) of respondents receive formal mentorship and 44.7% (n = 38) of participants have been sponsored for leadership positions, research opportunities, or speaking engagements. The total number of anticipated hires in the next 5 years is 129; that number goes up to 194 in 10 years. The challenge in hiring was graded as 8/10 with 10 being the most challenging. This survey provides important data about the current state of pediatric cardiac anesthesiology and the need to address staffing and academic support. With nearly one-third of those practicing in the field considering leaving the pediatric cardiac subspecialty and with the decreasing number of fellows per year, there is a significant cause for concern for staffing, especially when the demand for practitioners in this field is increasing. In addition, even though the majority of faculty reported being involved in academic activities, many do not receive academic time for these activities and less than half receive formal mentorship or have been sponsored for leadership positions, publications, research opportunities, or speaking engagements. Further work to recruit, retain, and develop pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists is warranted.","Deutsch Nina, Grant Stephanie, Zabala Luis, Staffa Steven J, Lau Jennifer, Andropoulos Dean, Geiduschek Jeremy, Kurth C Dean, Nasr Viviane G",Anesthesia and analgesia,2025,40014483,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000007440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014483,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Formal mentorship, sponsorship for leadership positions, research opportunities, or speaking engagements","Pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists, division chiefs/directors of pediatric cardiac anesthesia programs, program directors of pediatric cardiac anesthesia fellowships, and fellowship graduates from the past 10 years","Address staffing and academic support issues, recruit, retain, and develop pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists"
Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia versus epidural anesthesia in the treatment of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective comparative study.,"Total hip arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure used to reduce pain and improve hip joint function in patients with advanced hip inflammation. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia is more effective in reducing postoperative anxiety. In addition, combined spinal and epidural anesthesia is associated with a lower incidence of respiratory complications like atelectasis. This retrospective comaprative study compared the post operative analgesic effect and postoperative recovery of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and patient-controlled epidural analgesia. A total of 200 patients received hip arthroplasty from January 2018 to January 2021. The patients were divided into the study group (patient-controlled epidural analgesia group, N = 110) and the control group (intravenous patient-controlled analgesia group, N = 90). Various factors were examined, including the surgical procedure, Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), resting visual analogue scale (VAS), Bruggrmann comfort scale (BCS), postoperative recovery, and the prevalence of postoperative adverse reactions. The study group showed statistically significant shorter operation time, respiratory recovery time, eye opening time, extubation time, and orientation recovery time, lower RSS score at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h compared to the control group. Similarly, the VAS score in the study group was significantly lower at the same time points after operation. Moreover, the BCS scores in the study group were significantly higher at the same time points after operation. The study group demonstrated statistically significant higher comfort levels and shorter times for first mobilization, first bowel movement, and length of hospital stay compared to the control group. Only four cases in the study group experienced nausea and vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, and respiratory depression, while 13 cases in the control group experienced nausea and vomiting, rash, lower limb fatigue, hypotension, drowsiness, dizziness, postoperative mental disorder, and respiratory depression. The results reveal that patient-controlled epidural analgesia offers superior pain relief, lower side effects, better post-operative analgesic effect, and better postoperative recovery. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia shows great promising clinical application potential for anesthesia after total hip arthroplasty.","Wu Qian, Zhi Xiao Jun",BMC anesthesiology,2025,39979828,PMC11841313,10.1186/s12871-025-02931-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979828,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11841313,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Development of an Educational Curriculum for Implanting and Managing Vagus Nerve Stimulators for Epilepsy.,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices are commonly used for extracranial neuromodulation of drug-resistant epilepsy. These devices are implanted by multiple surgical subspecialties and managed by practitioners with varying levels of epilepsy-specific expertise. The North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) education committee presents a curriculum defining level-dependent recommendations within the six-core competency rubric for the implantation and management of VNS devices. A multidisciplinary (anesthesiology, neurology, neurosurgery, and physiatrists) and diverse (advanced practice providers, physicians, and surgeons) subcommittee of the NANS education committee met virtually over a year to develop a curriculum following the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies. The subcommittee used a consensus approach, evidence-based development strategy; once completed, the VNS curriculum was approved by the NANS board. The subcommittee developed a VNS curriculum as a standard to be used for implanting surgeons, managing physicians, and advanced practice providers. The vertical orientation of the curriculum uses the ACGME educational core competencies framework; within this paradigm is a horizontal progression of skills with distinct competency groups for implanting surgeons and/or managing physicians. The horizontal progression defines the expected competence for early learner, advanced learner, and independent practitioner.

The Creation and Impact of Leadership Development Programs for Women in Medicine with a Focus on Anesthesiology.,"The Association of American Medical Colleges sounded the alarm in 1996 about inequity between the sexes in medicine, prompting organizations to help women advance into leadership positions. Slow, modest changes have occurred, but similar issues and barriers still exist such as lack of mentorship, poor self-promotion, and improving leadership skills in women. One way to help bridge the gender gap is to provide women the tools through leadership development programs, of which several have proven useful. The extent of these programs' impact is not fully known, but they are helping remove these barriers.","Esfahani Kamilla, Hopf Harriet, Forkin Katherine T",Anesthesiology clinics,2025,39890319,,10.1016/j.anclin.2024.08.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39890319,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effects of psilocybin on mouse brain microstructure.,"There is surging interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds like psilocybin in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses like major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent studies point to the rapid antidepressant effect of psilocybin; however, the biological mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown. This study determines the feasibility of using diffusion MRI to characterize and define the potential spatiotemporal microstructural differences in the brain following psilocybin treatment in C57BL/6J male mice. 11-15 week-old C57BL/6J male mice were randomized to receive psilocybin, 6F-DET (6-fluoro-N,Ndiethyltryptamine), or saline and <i>ex vivo</i> imaged 24h (n=18) and 72h (n=18) post treatment. A one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison testing (Bonferroni correction) assessed diffusion metric differences (tractography, DTI, NODDI) between the three groups and was performed in the following regions of interest: amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, primary visual cortex area, frontal association cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex at 24h and 72h post drug administration. Psilocybin treated mice demonstrated structural connectivity differences at 72h in the frontal association cortex (compared to saline, mean tract length increases, p=0.03). Psilocybin also induced microstructural differences at 24h post-injection in the primary visual cortex (compared to saline, MD increases, p=0.02) and 72h post-injection in the striatum (compared to saline; MD increases, p= 0.02, NDI decreases, p=0.02) and hippocampus (compared to saline; MD increases, p=0.04, NDI decreases, p=0.02). Diffusion microstructure imaging and white matter tractography are sensitive methods to detect and characterize the neural substrates and microstructural differences accompanying psilocybin treatment. These findings suggest the potential role for diffusion microstructure imaging to quantify the bioeffects of psychedelics like psilocybin on the brain, monitor treatment response, and identify salient clinical endpoints in an emerging therapeutic option for patients with MDD. dMRI= diffusion-weighted MRI; 6F-DET= 6-fluoro-N,N-diethyltryptamine; NODDI= neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging; DTI= diffusion tensor imaging; NDI= neurite density index; ODI= orientation dispersion index; FA= fractional anisotropy; MD= mean diffusivity; MTL= mean tract length; mPFC= medial prefrontal cortex.","Frautschi Paloma C, Singh Ajay P, Stowe Nicholas A, Grady Sean M, Zahid Zarmeen, Banks Matthew I, Yu John-Paul J",AJNR.

Regional Anesthesia in Thyroid Surgery for a Giant Intrathoracic Goiter With Tracheal Compression.,"Cervical plexus block (CPB), like other types of regional anesthesia, represents an alternative anesthetic technique in those cases where the performance of general anesthesia (GA) carries an increased risk both for the patient and the outcome of the operative treatment. It has traditionally been used for years in carotid surgery as an alternative to GA, especially due to the possibility of superior monitoring - the awake patient. However, its effectiveness has been proven in other types of neck surgery, primarily in thyroid surgery, neck dissections, tracheostomy, central venous catheter insertion, clavicle surgery, etc. In most cases, it provides adequate and satisfactory analgesia of the anterolateral side of the neck (C1-C4 roots), at the same time avoiding all the negative effects on the patient that GA entails. Superficial block of the cervical plexus (SBCP) is a variant known for its simplicity and low number of complications. It can be performed traditionally with the help of external landmarks or with ultrasound-guided orientation.  The case report describes the anesthesiology challenges of maintaining the airway caused by a high degree of compression by the retrosternal goiter and the possibility of performing such an operation under regional anesthesia. In this case, a male patient in his seventies presented with a giant retrosternal goiter and symptoms associated with tracheal compression. Due to significant tracheal narrowing, induction of general endotracheal anesthesia was not possible. The surgical treatment was performed through a low-collar incision with neck extension under bilateral superficial cervical plexus (BSCPB) block anesthesia. The study concludes that BSCPB can provide a satisfactory degree of analgesia for operative procedures like this, where GA poses a high risk.","Milosevic Dragan, Sobot Novakovic Suzana, Djurdjevic Svraka Anita, Švraka Dragan",Cureus,2024,39872567,PMC11770238,10.7759/cureus.76495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39872567,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11770238,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Faculty Perceptions on the Roles of Mentoring, Advising, and Coaching in an Anesthesiology Residency Program: Mixed Methods Study.","Mentoring, advising, and coaching are essential components of resident education and professional development. Despite their importance, there is limited literature exploring how anesthesiology faculty perceive these practices and their role in supporting residents. This study aims to investigate anesthesiology faculty perspectives on the significance, implantation strategies, and challenges associated with mentorship, advising, and coaching in resident education. A comprehensive survey was administrated to 93 anesthesiology faculty members at Washington University School of Medicine. The survey incorporated quantitative Likert-scale questions and qualitative short-answer responses to assess faculty perceptions of the value, preferred formats, essential skills, and capacity for fulfilling multiple roles in these support practices. Additional areas of focus included the impact of staffing shortages, training requirements, and the potential of these practices to enhance faculty recruitment and retention. The response rate was 44% (n=41). Mentoring was identified as the most important aspect, with 88% (n=36) of faculty respondents indicating its significance, followed by coaching, which was highlighted by 78% (n=32) of respondents. The majority felt 1 faculty member can effectively hold multiple roles for a given trainee. The respondents desired additional training for roles and found roles to be rewarding. All roles were seen as facilitating recruitment and retention. Barriers included faculty burnout; confusion between roles; time constraints; and desire for specialized training, especially in coaching skills. Implementing structured mentoring, advising, and coaching can profoundly impact resident education but requires role clarity, protected time, culture change, leadership buy-in, and faculty development. Targeted training and operational investments could enable programs to actualize immense benefits from high-quality resident support modalities. Respondents emphasized that resident needs evolve over time, necessitating flexibility in appropriate faculty guidance. While coaching demands unique skills, advising hinges on expertise and mentoring depends on relationship-building. Systematic frameworks of coaching, mentoring, and advising programs could unlock immense potential. However, realizing this vision demands surmounting barriers such as burnout, productivity pressures, confusion about logistics, and culture change. Ultimately, prioritizing resident support through high-quality personalized guidance can recenter graduate medical education.","Nykiel-Bailey Sydney, Burrows Kathryn, Szafarowicz Bianca E, Moquin Rachel",JMIR medical education,2025,39864951,PMC11774320,10.2196/60255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39864951,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11774320,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Implementing structured mentoring, advising, and coaching",Anesthesiology faculty members at Washington University School of Medicine,"Enhanced resident education, faculty recruitment and retention, and overcoming barriers such as burnout, productivity pressures, confusion about logistics, and culture change"
Efficacy of butylphthalide in preventing cognitive decline in ischaemic stroke survivors: a 12-month prospective following-up study.,"Cognitive decline is a significant concern for stroke survivors, affecting their quality of life and increasing their burden on the healthcare system. DL-3-n-butylphthalide (butylphthalide) has shown efficacy in the short-term treatment of various cognitive impairments. This study evaluated the efficacy of butylphthalide in preventing cognitive decline over a 12-month period in patients with ischaemic stroke. This prospective following-up study involved patients newly diagnosed with ischaemic stroke between 1 month and 6 months after stroke onset and not in the acute phase. Patients were assigned to either the butylphthalide or control group. Cognitive function was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Statistical analyses included t-tests, χ<sup>2</sup> tests and multivariate regression analyses. Butylphthalide was negatively associated with the MMSE D-value (β=-0.122; 95% CI -1.932 to -0.298; p=0.003) and the MMSE D-value percentage (β=-0.117; 95% CI -0.057 to -0.011; p=0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that butylphthalide treatment was negatively associated with both changes in orientation and language score. Additionally, the incidence of cognitive decline was significantly lower in the butylphthalide group (OR, 0.612; p=0.020) than the control group. An age of ≥60 years and lower educational level were identified as risk factors for lower cognitive score and cognitive decline. This study demonstrated that butylphthalide is effective in preventing cognitive decline in patients with ischaemic stroke. These findings have significant implications for clinical practice, suggesting that butylphthalide could be incorporated into standard post-stroke care regimens to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare burden. Additional multicentre double-blind trials are recommended to confirm these results in diverse populations.","Han Qingqing, Zhao Xiyu, Shao Yingzhe, Tan Fengtao, Wen Haotian, Wang Di, Li Xiao, Wang Yunfan, Tu Jun, Wang Lifeng, Ning Xianjia, Wang Jinghua, Li Yan",Stroke and vascular neurology,2025,39863299,,10.1136/svn-2024-003611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39863299,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The effect of anesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction in adults undergoing cataract surgery: a systematic review.,"We systematically reviewed the evidence on the effect of anesthetic methods and drugs on the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after cataract surgery. The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant English reports published from 2000 to August 2024. After full-text screening and checking the quality assessment of each article using the JBI checklist, 9 relevant articles were included in this study. The included articles were reviewed to explain how different anesthetic modalities and drugs may affect the incidence of POCD after cataract surgery. Our study aimed to systematically investigate the relationship between various methods of anesthesia and POCD for people undergoing cataract surgery. We included 9 clinical trials with 1014 participants, which analyzed the incidence of POCD after anesthetic interventions. Four articles compared the effect of anesthetic modality interventions on POCD and five studies compared the effect of anesthetic drugs on POCD. The studies used various cognitive measurement scales, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia scale, PALT, and VF test. All articles that compared local and topical anesthesia found no statistically significant difference in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction at postop days 1 and 7. General anesthesia may cause POCD approximately twofold than local anesthesia. Ketamine, Midazolam, or Dexmedetomidine seemed to reduce postoperative cognitive complications compared to the control group‌‌. This systematic review investigates how different anesthetic techniques and drugs may affect the incidence of POCD. The available literature is far from being conclusive and further studies are needed to reach any significant conclusions. It is necessary to adopt an appropriate anesthesia method for elderly and high-risk patients, especially people who have a history of cognitive problems‌‌ undergoing elective cataract surgery, to reduce cognitive complications after surgery.‌.","Foroughi Elaheh, Brogi Etrusca, Forfori Francesco, Hashemi Seyyed Taghi",BMC anesthesiology,2025,39849420,PMC11755816,10.1186/s12871-025-02897-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39849420,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11755816,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Decay in Physiologic Knowledge since Medical School among Critical Care Fellows (DIP Study).,"<b>Background:</b> Rapid accumulation of knowledge and skills by trainees in the intensive care unit assumes prior mastery of clinically relevant core physiology concepts. However, for many fellows, their foundational physiology knowledge was acquired years earlier during their preclinical medical curricula and variably reinforced during the remainder of their undergraduate and graduate medical training. <b>Objective:</b> We sought to assess the retention of clinically relevant pulmonary physiology knowledge among pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) and critical care medicine (CCM) fellows. <b>Methods:</b> A composite examination was developed from an initial set of questions used in preclinical pulmonary physiology courses at four separate medical schools. These questions passed through multiple rounds of review by various educators to arrive at a set of 15 multiple-choice questions. The test was administered to incoming first-year PCCM and CCM fellows at seven institutions during their 2021 fellowship orientation. <b>Results:</b> Forty-one first-year PCCM (<i>n</i> = 24) and CCM (<i>n</i> = 17) fellows completed the examination, and the proportion correct among the fellows was compared with that of medical students for each item. Although all questions were deemed to be clinically relevant, preclinical medical students significantly outperformed the incoming fellows. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest considerable decay of clinically relevant pulmonary physiologic knowledge during residency training and point to a need for longitudinal retrieval practice to reinforce these concepts during the course of medical school clerkship years and postgraduate clinical training as well as consideration of dedicated pulmonary physiology curricula for PCCM and CCM fellowship programs.","Maximous Stephanie I, Acho Megan, Ahari Jalil, Hawkins Katrina, Jamieson Daniel B, Luks Andrew M, Poston Jason, Seam Nitin, Shah Nirav G, Sun Junfeng, Woods Christian J, Lee Burton W",ATS scholar,2025,39841527,,10.34197/ats-scholar.2024-0036OC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39841527,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Predilection for Perplexion: Preoperative microstructural damage is linked to postoperative delirium.,"Postoperative delirium is the most common postsurgical complication in older adults and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). However, the neurological basis of this increased risk-whether postoperative delirium unmasks latent preoperative pathology or leads to AD-relevant pathology after perioperative brain injury-remains unclear. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques now enable the detection of subtle brain features or damage that may underlie clinical symptoms. Among these, Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) can help identify microstructural brain damage, even in the absence of visible macro-anatomical abnormalities. To investigate potential brain microstructural abnormalities associated with postoperative delirium and cognitive function, we analyzed pre- and post-operative diffusion MRI data from 111 patients aged ≥60 years who underwent non-cardiac/non-intracranial surgery. Specifically, we investigated preoperative variation in diffusion metrics within the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region in which prior work has identified glucose metabolism alterations in the delirious brain, and a key region in the early accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in preclinical AD. We also examined the relationship of preoperative PCC NODDI abnormalities with preoperative cognitive function. Compared to patients who did not develop postoperative delirium (n=99), we found increased free water (FISO) and neurite density index (NDI) and decreased orientation dispersion index (ODI) in the dorsal PCC before surgery among those who later developed postoperative delirium (n=12). These FISO differences before surgery remained present at six weeks postoperatively, while these NDI and ODI differences did not. Preoperative dorsal PCC NDI and ODI values were also positively associated with preoperative attention/concentration performance, independent of age, education level, and global brain atrophy. Yet, these diffusion metrics were not correlated with cerebrospinal fluid Aβ positivity or levels. These results suggest that preoperative latent brain abnormalities within the dorsal PCC may underlie susceptibility to postoperative delirium, independent of AD-related (i.e., Aβ) neuropathology. Furthermore, these preoperative microstructural differences in the dorsal PCC were linked to preoperative deficits in attention/concentration, a core feature of postoperative delirium. Our findings highlight microstructural vulnerability within the PCC, a key region of the default mode network, as a neuroanatomic locus that can help explain the link between preoperative attention/concentration deficits and increased postoperative delirium risk among vulnerable older surgical patients.","Reekes Tyler H, Upadhya Vinith R, Merenstein Jenna L, Cooter-Wright Mary, Madden David J, Reese Melody A, Boykin Piper C, Timko Noah J, Moul Judd W, Garrigues Grant E, Martucci Katherine T, Cohen Harvey Jay, Whitson Heather E, Mathew Joseph P, Devinney Michael J, Zetterberg Henrik, Blennow Kaj, Shaw Leslie M, Waligorska Teresa, Browndyke Jeffrey N, Berger Miles",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,39830255,PMC11741491,10.1101/2025.01.08.24319243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39830255,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11741491,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The identification of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid metabolites causally associated with mental disorders from a genetic perspective.,"Metabolomics research is a promising orientation for the diagnosis and intervention of several diseases, and observational studies have found many metabolic profiles to be associated with mental disorders. However, the causal relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites and mental disorders has not been established. We identified independent genetic variants associated with plasma, CSF metabolites, and mental disorders from pooled data in the published Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships. Genetic information on the screened mental disorders were derived from separate GWAS data sources as exploratory and validation datasets. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was adopted as the primary method for MR analysis. We also applied sensitivity analyses to examine the reliability of the MR analysis results. Further enrichment analyses provided a deeper insight into the biological mechanisms of the three mental disorders. A dual analysis of the exploratory and validation datasets identified eight plasma metabolites and three CSF metabolites causally associated with MDD, two plasma metabolites and one CSF metabolite causally associated with anxiety disorders, and four plasma metabolites and two CSF causally associated with ASD. Horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity tests indicate the validity of our MR studies. Enrichment analysis uncovered metabolic pathways associated with disease. Our study identified plasma and cerebrospinal fluid metabolites that were causally associated with 3 mental disorders. Characterization of disease-associated metabolites not only deepens the understanding of pathological mechanisms, but also supports clinical diagnosis and prognosis.","Song Yanhong, Wu Xiaodong, Wu Ziyi, Zhao Ping",Journal of affective disorders,2025,39793616,,10.1016/j.jad.2025.01.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39793616,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Role of M1/M2 macrophages in pain modulation.,"Pain is a signal of inflammation that can have both protective and pathogenic effects. Macrophages, significant components of the immune system, play crucial roles in the occurrence and development of pain, particularly in neuroimmune communication. Macrophages exhibit plasticity and heterogeneity, adopting either pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes depending on their functional orientation. Recent research highlights the contribution of macrophages to pain dynamics by undergoing changes in their functional polarity, leading to macrophage activation, tissue infiltration, and cytokine secretion. M1 macrophages release pro-inflammatory mediators that are not only essential in defending against infections, but also contributing to tissue damage and the elicitation of pain. However, this process can be counteracted by M2 macrophages, facilitating pain relief through producing anti-inflammatory cytokines and opioid peptides or enhancing efferocytosis. M1 and M2 macrophages play important roles in both the initiation and mitigation of pain.","Zhu Xiaoye, Chen Saige, Xie Yongqiu, Cheng Zhigang, Zhu Xiaoyan, Guo Qulian",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Female dental students' perceptions on barriers and motivators in pursuing oral and maxillofacial surgery.,"Although females represent more than half of US dental students, less than 10% are practicing oral surgeons. This study sought to identify barriers and motivators perceived by female dental students in their D1 and D4 years concerning a career in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). This cross-sectional study used a single survey in 2023 sent to all US dental schools for female D1 and D4 students. Perceived barriers and motivating factors were rated on a scale from 0 to 5, 5 indicating the highest importance. For comparisons between D1 and D4, the data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test and adjusted for multiple correction using the Bonferroni method. All responses were pooled to identify statistically significant barriers and motivating factors. Combined cohort barriers identified were time commitment (86.2%), family sacrifices (75.2%), long work hours (70.7%), and need to perform at top of class (64.6%). The important motivators were financial security (82.1%), scope (71.2%), respect (62%), and lifestyle after residency (51.4%). A statistically significant difference between groups was on the need to excel academically, with D1 students rating it more important (4.14/5) and D4's rating 3.51/5 (adjusted p-value = 0.02, which is less than 0.05). The responses for motivation to pursue OMS showed a significant difference, D1 rating it 3.81/5 and D4 rating it 3.26/5 (adjusted p-value = 0.03, which is less than 0.05).

Changes in the Affective Empathy of Osteopathic Students: a Longitudinal Study.,"Establishing an empathic bond of trust with patients is a characteristic that needs to be taught to medical students. Patients feel physicians are more caring if they sense their physician is empathetic. Yet, longitudinal studies have shown an erosion of affective empathy as allopathic medical students progress through their education. Although there are studies examining cognitive empathy among osteopathic students, there has not been a longitudinal study which has examined potential changes in affective empathy. During orientation to the Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine (M1 timepoint), and at the beginning of each subsequent academic year (M2-M4 timepoints), and just before graduation (M4F timepoint) the graduating classes of 2017-2019 were asked to voluntarily participate in a longitudinal study by filling out the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES), which measures affective empathy. Desired specialty choice and sex was also collected at each of the five timepoints. Specialty choice was divided into Core and Non-Core groups. Core specialties are ""people-oriented"" and have a large amount of patient contact and continuity of care and include Family and Internal Medicine, Ob/Gyn, Pediatrics and Psychiatry. Non-Core specialties are ""technical- or procedure-oriented"" and are those with little or no patient contact and/or continuity of care (e.g., Radiology, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, Anesthesiology). For men, BEES scores significantly dropped over the five timepoints (<i>p</i> < <i>0.001</i>). While men selecting Non-Core specialties had significant drops in scores (<i>p</i> = <i>0.001</i>); men who selected the Core specialties did not have a significant decrease. For women there was no significant drop in BEES scores, nor for women selecting Core or Non-Core specialties. Women always had larger BEES score averages than the men. Students selecting Core specialties better maintain their affective empathy than those who select Non-Core specialties. The decline in affective empathy scores for osteopathic students has differences when compared to a similar longitudinal study of allopathic medical students.","Newton Bruce W, Vaskalis Zachary T",Medical science educator,2024,39758472,PMC11699168,10.1007/s40670-024-02139-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39758472,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11699168,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Transitioning to residency: a qualitative study exploring residents' perspectives on strategies for adapting to residency.,"The transition to residency (TTR) goes along with new opportunities for learning and development, which can also be challenging, despite the availability of preparation courses designed to ease the transition process. Although the TTR highly depends on the organization, individual combined with organizational strategies that advance adaptation are rarely investigated. This study explores residents' strategies and experiences with organizational strategies to help them adapt to residency. We conducted a template analysis of interview transcripts with 16 second-year residents from different hospital-based specialties in the Netherlands. To identify residents' perceptions of their own and other healthcare professionals' strategies, our template consisted of the individual and organizational strategies originating from the Organizational Socialization theory. Residents employed five individual strategies: observing, asking questions, establishing social relationships, and seeking information. These strategies helped them learn their tasks, appropriate behaviors, and integrate into their teams.

Factors influencing TTR included individual strategies, such as establishing social relationships, and organizational strategies, particularly interactional (relationships with healthcare professionals) and systemic strategies (training program structure). Residents' perceptions varied on whether these strategies facilitated or hindered their TTR. TTR involves dynamic interactions between residents and healthcare professionals, bridging individual and organizational strategies. This largely unexplored interaction adds a new dimension to Organizational Socialization theory. Importantly, residents' perceptions of these strategies varied: some thrived with independence, while others needed structured guidance.

Effects of head direction during prone position on postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing thoracolumbar spine surgery: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Prone positioning with head rotation can influence cerebral haemodynamics, potentially affecting cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. Elderly patients with impaired brain perfusion and oxygenation are at an increased risk of developing postoperative delirium (POD). Despite this, few studies have explored whether head orientation during prone positioning contributes to POD in older adults, an aspect often overlooked by clinicians. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of head orientation during prone positioning on the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing thoracolumbar spine surgery. This study is a single-centre, randomised, single-blind trial, with the assessors blinded to the intraoperative head position. Eligible participants are patients aged ≥65 years undergoing elective thoracolumbar spine surgery. A total of 500 patients will be randomly assigned to either the prone position with the head centred, or the prone position with the head deviated. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD, measured using the 3 min Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) until postoperative day 5. Secondary outcomes include the severity of POD assessed by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), postoperative cognitive impairment evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>), changes in vertebrobasilar artery and middle cerebral artery haemodynamics, and plasma levels of calcium channel-binding protein S100 subunit beta (S100B) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Ethical approval was obtained from Yancheng No. 1 People's Hospital Ethics Examination Committee (2023-K-120-01).

Current Progress on Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction: An Update.,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) represents a significant clinical concern, particularly among elderly surgical patients. It is characterized by a decline in cognitive performance, affecting memory, attention, coordination, orientation, verbal fluency, and executive function. This decline in cognitive abilities leads to longer hospital stays and increased mortality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in understanding the relevant pathogenic factors, possible pathogenic mechanisms, diagnosing, prevention and treatment of POCD, as well as suggesting future research directions. It discusses neuronal damage, susceptible genes, central cholinergic system, central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, stress response and glucocorticoids, and oxidative stress in the development of POCD, aiming to uncover the pathological mechanism and develop effective treatment strategies for POCD.","Sun Jing, Du Xiaohong, Chen Yong",Journal of integrative neuroscience,2024,39735960,,10.31083/j.jin2312224,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39735960,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Dentists' views on the role orientation of dental hygienists in China: A qualitative content analysis.,"A dental hygienist is an indispensable auxiliary staff in stomatology who assists people in achieving an optimum level of oral health. Despite advancements in dental medical services, our country has not yet established the position of dental hygienists. The current imbalance in the allocation of dental human resources has created a significant disparity between the demand for and supply of dental auxiliaries. By defining the responsibilities and functions of dental hygienists and establishing this position, this gap could be mitigated. The present study was conducted to explore dentists' views on the role orientation, duty division and development situation of dental hygienists, in order to provide a reference for the establishment and training of the dental hygienist occupation in China in the future. We use a descriptive qualitative design. A total of 13 dentists were selected through purposive sampling with maximum variation. Data were collected three months through semi-structured in-depth interviews and audio recorded, then carefully transcribed and analyzed using inductive content analysis approach. This study included 13 dentists (9 males and 4 females; age 33-59 years), which was sufficient to reach data saturation. We generated three themes emerged: (a) national condition determined comprehensive paraprofessionals; (b) auxiliary personnel of multi-professional integration; (c) opportunities and challenges coexist. Existing knowledge of the role orientation, duty division and development situation of dental hygienists in China is limited. A detailed exploration of this topic can provide guidance for the future duty division of dental auxiliary personnel and dental health care teams building.","Jiang Xiaochen, Ding Zhiguo, Su Yanlei, Wang Fei, Wang Weifeng, Wang Ziyang, Qiu Xueling, Sun Chenxi, Sun Fan, Tang Lu, Fu Chongjian",BMC oral health,2024,39731062,PMC11673827,10.1186/s12903-024-05333-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39731062,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11673827,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Inhibitory effect of low-dose esketamine on cough induced by sufentanil during the induction of anesthesia and postoperative impact on mental health status: a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial.","Intravenous administration of sufentanil during anesthesia induction induces cough (SIC), sometimes triggers a severe reaction. We wanted to investigate the inhibitory effect of low-dose esketamine on cough induced by sufentanil during the induction of general anesthesia, as well as its postoperative impact on mental status (MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A). A total of 256 adult patients were randomly allocated to receive either esketamine (Group EK) or normal saline (Group C). One minute before the administration of sufentanil, Group EK and Group C were injected with esketamine (0.05 mg/kg, diluted with normal saline to 3 ml) and normal saline (3 ml), respectively. The primary outcomes were the incidence (the basis of the presence or absence of cough) and severity (the frequency of cough episodes) of cough within 2 min after sufentanil injection.The secondary outcomes included hemodynamic variables (MAP, HR, and SPi), mental status (MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A) and postoperative events (time to awareness, duration of orientation recovery and degree of satisfaction with anesthesia). A total of 236 adult patients were randomized into two groups (n = 236): Group EK (n = 118) and Group C (n = 118). The incidence of cough in Group EK (21.2%) was significantly lower than that in Group C (40.7%) (P < 0.05). The incidence rates for each grade were as follows: 9.3% and 16.9% for Grade 2, and 0% and 4.2% for Grade 3, respectively.The differences had statistical senses.The MAP and HR at T4 (during tracheal intubation) and T5 (1 min post-intubation) were significantly lower in Group EK (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A, time to awareness, duration of orientation recovery or satisfaction with anesthesia. Pretreatment with low-dose esketamine can reduce the incidence and severity of cough induced by sufentanil and maintain hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction without increasing mental status (MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A).

Enhancing early career development in pain medicine: the comprehensive role of mentorship.,"Mentorship plays a vital role in pain medicine, guiding professionals from medical training through independent practice. This article explores how mentorship fosters research, enhances clinical competence, and promotes multidisciplinary collaboration. Drawing on insights from leading institutions, we propose a structured mentorship framework tailored to different career stages. Effective mentorship cultivates research skills, expands academic networks, and provides early exposure to the field, shaping long-term career trajectories. It also strengthens clinical expertise, encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration, and advances diversity, equity, and inclusion in medicine. Structured academic mentorship models offer longitudinal guidance for sustained professional development.

Beta oscillation modulations of the orienting attention network effect correlate with dopamine-dependent motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.,"Attention impairment, a prevalent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), plays a crucial role in movement disorders. PD patients exhibit abnormalities in the attentional network related to alerting, orienting, and executive control. While dopamine medications have well-documented effects on motor function, their impact on attention networks and the underlying neural mechanisms involved in motor functions remain unclear. In this study, we utilized a modified attention network test to investigate the neural correlates underlying attention network effects measured by electroencephalography (EEG) in 29 PD patients, both on and off dopamine medication and examined their association with motor performance. Interestingly, we found that dopamine medication specifically modulated the orienting effect of the attention network. We analyzed event-related potential components, time-frequency oscillations, and brain network connectivity, as determined by the weighted phase lag index, within the orienting effect under different dopamine medication states. We observed that event-related desynchronization in the beta<sub>low</sub>, event-related synchronization in the beta<sub>high</sub>, and functional connectivity of the beta<sub>low</sub> in the frontal, central, and parietal were regulated by dopamine medication in the orienting effect. We discovered an association between the attention network's orienting effect and motor performance alterations, which may be attributed to enhanced functional connectivity within the beta<sub>low</sub>-brain network. Enhanced weighted phase lag index of the beta<sub>low</sub>-brain network in the orienting effect may contribute to dopamine-dependent changes in motor performance. These preliminary findings provide insights into the EEG mechanisms that underlie the impact of the orienting effect in individuals with PD, shedding light on the influence of dopamine medication and its potential role in regulating top-down attention processes. These findings could help in the advancement of substitution strategies and may have the potential to address both motor and cognitive deficits in PD patients.","Jiang Bo, Ding Lei, Chen Keke, Huang Qiwei, Han Xingyu, Jin Zhaohui, Cao Li-Zhi, Zhang Jianxu, Li Qing, Xue Cuiping, He Yiliu, Fang Boyan, Pei Guangying, Yan Tianyi",Brain structure & function,2024,39671095,,10.1007/s00429-024-02863-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39671095,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Becoming Leaders - A Qualitative Research Study on the Priorities and Concerns of Early Career Women Faculty in Academic Medicine.,"Gender inequity persists in high-level leadership within academic medicine. Understanding the perspectives of early career women faculty could clarify how to recruit and support women who pursue high-level leadership. This study explored the specific priorities and concerns that may influence the recruitment of women leaders in the future. Twenty-five assistant professors (mean: 1.8 years at rank) completed the Early Career Women's Leadership Program and participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews in 2023. Data were analyzed using an iterative, thematic constant comparison process informed by constructivist grounded theory. The authors identified four themes. In theme one, participants described the <i>importance of being seen and valued as a whole person</i>, with consideration of their personal and professional lives. They sought mentorship and leadership positions that supported their work-life integration. In theme two, <i>women balanced an interplay between the individual and the collective</i> when considering themselves as future leaders. From the individual perspective, participants prioritized personal values like humility and compassion when discussing preferred leadership styles. From the collective perspective, they prioritized inclusivity and teamwork. Theme three showed <i>discomfort with the unknown</i> with a desire to fully understand a leadership position and its impact on personal and professional life. Participants wondered about having the authority and resources to realistically make meaningful change and whether they could adequately prepare to lead. The fourth theme was <i>representation mattered</i>. Participants valued having women leaders who have experienced similar challenges as themselves. These leaders inspired participants to believe that they could also achieve and succeed in high-level leadership. Early career women balanced numerous factors when considering whether to pursue high-level leadership in academic medicine. Understanding women's priorities and concerns can enable institutions to prepare women faculty to lead and ultimately recruit and retain them in high-level leadership.","Liu Olivia, Grieb Suzanne M, Halsey Jordan N, Levine Rachel B, Oliva-Hemker Maria, Lee Jennifer K",Journal of healthcare leadership,2024,39649702,PMC11624522,10.2147/JHL.S499001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39649702,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11624522,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Role of Neural Circuits in Cognitive Impairment.,"Cognitive impairment refers to abnormalities in learning, memory and cognitive judgment, mainly manifested as symptoms such as decreased memory, impaired orientation and reduced computational ability. As the fundamental unit of information processing in the brain, neural circuits have recently attracted great attention due to their functions in regulating pain, emotion and behavior. Furthermore, a growing number of studies have suggested that neural circuits play an important role in cognitive impairment. Neural circuits can affect perception, attention and decision-making, they can also regulate language skill, thinking and memory. Pathological conditions crucially affecting the integrity and preservation of neural circuits and their connectivity will heavily impact cognitive abilities. Nowadays, technological developments have led to many novel methods for studying neural circuits, such as brain imaging, optogenetic techniques, and chemical genetics approaches. Therefore, neural circuits show great promise as a potential target in mitigating cognitive impairment. In this review we discuss the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and the regulation and detection of neural circuits, thus highlighting the role of neural circuits in cognitive impairment. Hence, therapeutic agents against cognitive impairment may be developed that target neural circuits important in cognition.","Zhang Li, Liu Guodong, Peng Yaonan, Gao Jinqi, Tian Mi",Neurochemical research,2024,39644416,,10.1007/s11064-024-04309-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39644416,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Understanding Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellowship Interest: A National Survey of the Resident Experience.,"The field of pediatric anesthesiology faces an impending shortage of fellowship-trained physicians. Despite this projection, fewer anesthesiology residents are opting to pursue a fellowship. To better understand the current perspective and motivation of trainees to pursue a career in pediatric anesthesiology, we surveyed anesthesiology residents across the United States. Our primary aims were to assess the understanding of the current workforce shortage as well as explore the impact of both exposure and characteristics of the anesthesia resident rotation on the decision to pursue pediatric anesthesiology fellowship. A 25-question Qualtrics survey was distributed to members of the Pediatric Anesthesia Leadership Council and Education Committee within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and to anesthesiology residency program directors based in the United States. The survey received 201 responses. Of the respondents, 29% were in Clinical Anesthesia Year 3, 25% in Year 2, 19% in Year 1, and 10% in their intern year. The analysis revealed that self-reported adequate exposure to high-acuity cases and advanced procedures (arterial lines, central lines, and nerve blocks) significantly increased the likelihood of planning to pursue pediatric anesthesiology fellowship (adjusted Odd Ratio 8.47, 95% Confidence Interval, 1.65-43.4). Perceptions of faculty teaching, mentor availability, planned practice environment, and the presence of fellowship programs at the institution were not significantly associated with intentions to pursue pediatric anesthesiology fellowship. The journey toward specializing in pediatric anesthesiology is influenced by a complex interplay of factors. Among these, enhanced exposure to challenging cases and advanced procedures during the residency phase is emerging as a critical element. Such exposure not only equips residents with the necessary skills and confidence to handle complex pediatric anesthesia cases but also plays a pivotal role in attracting more trainees to this essential subspecialty.","Carullo Philip, Khan Sabina, Nause-Osthoff Rebecca, Gupta Ruchika, Xie James, Azamfirei Razvan, Tran Lieu, Wang Tammy",Paediatric anaesthesia,2025,39644206,,10.1111/pan.15049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39644206,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Enhanced exposure to high-acuity cases and advanced procedures (arterial lines, central lines, and nerve blocks) during the residency phase",Anesthesiology residents,Increased likelihood of planning to pursue pediatric anesthesiology fellowship
"Analysis of Transgender and Gender-Diverse Topics Within Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Curricular Content in Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellowship Programs in the United States and Canada-A Prospective Survey.","Transgender and gender-diverse individuals experience higher burdens of health disparities compared to their cisgender counterparts. Contributing factors include decreased access and denial of care, experiences and fear of medical violence, and increasing legislative barriers. These patients often report having to educate healthcare professionals due to lack of expertise of transgender and gender-diverse issues within the medical community, with training deficits observed at all levels of medical training. We surveyed pediatric anesthesiology fellowship directors in the United States and Canada with an aim to describe the current state of transgender and gender-diverse topics within diversity, equity, and inclusion curricular content across pediatric anesthesiology fellowship training programs. A 25-question descriptive, cross-sectional, electronic survey was created and distributed to all pediatric anesthesiology fellowship program directors in the United States and Canada investigating the inclusion of transgender and gender-diverse topics within diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum (if present) for pediatric anesthesiology fellows. A total of 33 responses were collected from 69 total invited programs. Diversity, equity, and inclusion curricula were present in 93.5% (29/31) of fellowship programs but only 29% (9/31) of programs included content specific to transgender and gender-diverse populations. Just 17% (5/29) of program directors thought their curriculum adequately prepared their graduates to care for transgender and gender-diverse patients. However, 69% (20/29) expressed a desire to see more educational content included in the future. Lack of knowledgeable faculty educators and time were the most chosen perceived barriers to inclusion. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate pediatric anesthesiology fellowship curricula for inclusion of transgender and gender-diverse topics within diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum. As the population of known transgender and gender-diverse youth increases, all pediatric anesthesiologists must be equipped to treat this population with appropriate clinical and cultural sensitivity. Future endeavors must include robust sexual orientation and gender identity data collection, access to educational materials from content experts, recruitment and empowerment of LGBTQ+ anesthesiologists, and increased dedicated time toward diversity, equity, and inclusion education, specifically in regard to the transgender and gender-diverse population. Lack of physician education on the care of transgender and gender-diverse patients is one of several factors contributing to the health disparities seen in this population; training deficits in the care of transgender and gender-diverse patients have been observed in all levels of medical training. Our data show a critical deficiency of transgender and gender-diverse topics within diversity, equity, and inclusion curricular content in pediatric anesthesiology fellowships in the United States and Canada and identify potential barriers to the inclusion of such content.","Krueger Merry E, Roque Remigio A, Reece-Nguyen Travis L, MacCormick Hilary",Paediatric anaesthesia,2025,39644198,PMC11806206,10.1111/pan.15053,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39644198,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11806206,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Mixed evidence for the relationship between HIV stigma and Pain in two studies of people with HIV in Florida.,"Previous work suggests that HIV stigma is associated with greater pain severity. We sought to characterize this relationship by examining intersectional identities that tend to be stigmatized (i.e., gender; sexual orientation) in two cross-sectional studies of people with HIV (PWH). In Study 1 (N = 840), participants responded to the Enacted Stigma Scale and the Brief Pain Inventory. We found a significant positive association between HIV stigma and pain severity (and between sexual orientation and pain severity), but no interaction effects. In Study 2 (N = 309), participants responded to Internalized Stigma Scale and the Brief Pain Inventory. We did not find a relationship between HIV stigma and pain severity but conceptually replicated the relationship between sexual orientation and pain severity. Results may be due to a small sample size in Study 2, or because the relationship between HIV stigma and pain is specific to enacted stigma (i.e., overt acts of stigma; Study 1) rather than internalized stigma (i.e., an intrapersonal aspect of stigma; Study 2). PERSPECTIVE: Among people with HIV (PWH), there is a positive relationship between enacted stigma and pain. This relationship between stigma and pain should be studied among other intersectional groups including gay men and women of color. PWH should be provided with supportive care for both physical and psychosocial symptoms.","Moran James B, Arnold-Tolbert Miranda, Cook Robert L, Boissoneault Jeff, Varma Deepthi S, Wang Yan, Hone Liana S E",The journal of pain,2025,39613125,,10.1016/j.jpain.2024.104746,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39613125,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Stereospecific Properties and Intracellular Transport of Novel Intrinsically Fluorescent Neurosteroids.,"Allopregnanolone (AlloP) is an example of neuroactive steroids (NAS), which is a potent allosteric activator of the γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA<sub><i>A</i></sub>) receptor. The mechanisms underlying the biological activity of AlloP and other NAS are only partially understood. Here, we present intrinsically fluorescent analogs of AlloP (MQ-323) and its 3β-epimer, epi-allopregnanolone (E-AlloP) (YX-11), and show, by a combination of spectroscopic and computational studies, that these analogs mimic the membrane properties of AlloP and E-AlloP very well. We found stereospecific differences in the orientation and dynamics of the NAS as well as in their impact on membrane permeability. However, all NAS are unable to condense the lipid bilayer, in stark contrast to cholesterol. Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electrophysiological measurements, we show that MQ-323 but not YX-11 binds at the intersubunit site of the ELICα<sub>1</sub>GABA<sub><i>A</i></sub> receptor and potentiates GABA-induced receptor currents. In aqueous solvents, YX-11 forms aggregates at much lower concentrations than MQ-323, and loading both analogs onto cyclodextrin allows for their uptake by human astrocytes, where they become enriched in lipid droplets (LDs), as shown by quantitative fluorescence microscopy. Trafficking of the NAS analogs is stereospecific, as uptake and lipid droplet targeting is more pronounced for YX-11 compared to MQ-323. In summary, we present novel minimally modified analogs of AlloP and E-AlloP, which enable us to reveal stereospecific membrane properties, allosteric receptor activation, and intracellular transport of these neurosteroids. Our fluorescence design strategy will be very useful for the analysis of other NAS in the future.","Akkerman Vibeke, Reinholdt Peter, Schnoor-Madsen Rasmus, Lauritsen Line, Bader Jad, Qian Minxing, Xu Yuanjiang, Akk Gustav, Scheidt Holger A, Müller Peter, Covey Douglas F, Evers Alex S, Kongsted Jacob, Wüstner Daniel",ACS chemical neuroscience,2024,39574303,PMC11892034,10.1021/acschemneuro.4c00571,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39574303,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11892034,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"""Bridging The Gap"" Medical Degree Preparatory Program (EMDP2) Military Students Provide Leadership and Mentorship to Classmates.","The lack of adequate diverse representation (racially, socioeconomically, gender, second career applicants, student parents, etc.) within secondary education in the United States has proven to be a challenging and complex, multifaceted problem, and despite ongoing efforts, one that continues to remain unsolved.

Importance of Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) Emitter Configuration for the Attenuation of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida auris Pathogens.,"The relative importance of different ultraviolet-C (UV-C) emitter configurations on the attenuation of vegetative bacterial and fungal pathogens has not been assessed. We hypothesized that emitter configuration would impact the efficacy of UV-C attenuation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus (</i> <i>S. aureus)</i> and <i>Candida auris</i> (<i>C. auris)</i> pathogens. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) <i>S.</i> <i>aureus</i> (ATCC 6538) and <i>C. auris</i> (ATCC MYA-5001<i>)</i> carriers (ReadyNowTM Test Carriers, Stratix Labs Corporation, Saint Paul, MN) were mounted on an aluminum stand along with three calibrated radiometers (International Light Technologies model ILT1270, Peabody, MA). Five UV-C emitter configurations were assessed, including three emitters with a triangular configuration about the stand and each rotating 360° (1), one emitter facing the stand and rotating 360° (2), three emitters facing the stand in a linear configuration and each rotating 5° (3), one emitter facing the stand and rotating 5° (4), and one emitter facing the stand and rotating 90° (5). Three serial experiments were conducted. The first experiment involved the establishment of the minimally effective irradiation dose (mean and standard deviation mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) required to achieve no growth (6-log reduction (LR)) with direct exposure to pathogen carriers positioned at the center of the lamp. We then assessed the relative efficacy of delivery of the minimally effective dose via the five emitter configurations in attenuating polycarbonate and textured pathogen carriers. Polycarbonate carriers were positioned at 25.5 and 69.5 inches from the floor and oriented vertically to the emitters. Textured plastic pathogen carriers were positioned at 47.5 or 58.5 inches from the floor and with a 45° or horizontal orientation to the emitters. Standard carriers (1""x0.9"") were used for both pathogens and large carriers (1""x3"") for <i>C. auris</i>,the latter to address the potential for cell clustering. With standard carriers, the minimally effective dose was 27.01± 0.15 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for <i>S. aureus</i> but was not achieved for <i>C. auris</i>. The minimally effective dose for large <i>C. auris</i> carriers was 596.62 ± 27.98 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. With standard carriers, all configurations achieved a >6 log reduction for <i>S. aureus,</i> and none achieved a >6 log reduction for <i>C. auris.</i> All configurations achieved a > 6 log reduction when 596.62 ± 27.98 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> was delivered to large <i>C. auris</i> carriers. Changing to textured plastic carriers (standard for <i>S. aureus</i> and large for <i>C. auris</i>) and varying height (47.5-69.5 inches) from the floor and orientation to the emitters (45° and horizontal), the mean ± standard deviation for <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>C. auris</i> log reductions with delivery of the minimally effective dose was 4.44 ± 2.02, 2.58 ± 2.37, 3.55 ± 2.67, 2.33 ± 2.47, and 3.00 ± 2.64 for configurations one through five, respectively. Configuration one achieved a significantly greater LR than configurations two (adjusted P = 0.0018) and four (adjusted P = 0.023). There were 22% (6/27) of sites ≥ 100 colony-forming units (CFU) following cleaning but before UV-C vs. 0% (0/27) of sites ≥ 100 CFU after surface disinfection cleaning and nine minutes of configuration three UV-C treatment (P = 0.023). The choice of UV-C emitter configuration can impact <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>C. auris</i> attenuation when there is indirect exposure to the pathogen. Emitter configuration should be considered as an important parameter for future UV-C technological assessments.","Loftus Randy W, Brindeiro Carmen T, Dexter Franklin, Parra Michelle C, Hwang Soyun M, Wanta Brendan, Szeluga Debra J, Hadder Brent A, Seering Melinda S, Charnin Jonathan E",Cureus,2024,39553089,PMC11566098,10.7759/cureus.71612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39553089,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11566098,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism among critically ill children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study.","Critically ill children and young adults with diabetic ketoacidosis are thought to be in a prothrombotic state. However, the rate of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism and associated risk factors in this population have not been identified. Children hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be at increased risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE). We sought to estimate the incidence of HA-VTE and identify unique prothrombotic risk factors in this population. We performed a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information Systems registry including patients aged 0 to 21 years hospitalized for DKA from January 2017 to December 2023 within 48 participating centers. The primary outcome was the frequency of HA-VTE. Secondary outcomes were rates of cerebral edema, central venous catheterization (CVC), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), infection, and length of stay (LOS). An adjusted logistic regression was employed to identify potential HA-VTE risk factors. Of the 27,613 patients studied, 93 (0.3%) developed a HA-VTE. Compared with those without HA-VTE, those with HA-VTE had a greater median LOS (10 [IQR, 5-21] vs 2 [IQR, 2-3] days) and rates of cerebral edema (25.8% vs 6.6%), CVC (23.7% vs 1.1%), infection (72% vs 23.5%), and IMV (39.8% vs 1.4%; all <i>P</i> < .001). In an adjusted logistic model, factors independently associated with increased HA-VTE were CVC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.49-6.19), infection (aOR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.81-7.56), IMV (aOR, 9.24; 95% CI, 4.83-17.56), and increasing LOS (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; all <i>P</i> < .01). The frequency of HA-VTE among critically ill children and young adults hospitalized for DKA was 0.3%. After prospective validation, putative risk factors (ie, CVC, IMV, infection, and extended LOS) may be incorporated into the design of forthcoming pediatric thromboprophylaxis trials.","DeMayo Kristin M, Havlicek Elizabeth E, Betensky Marisol, Goldenberg Neil A, Sochet Anthony A",Research and practice in thrombosis and haemostasis,2024,39552773,PMC11567947,10.1016/j.rpth.2024.102581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39552773,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11567947,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Declining pain medicine fellowship applications from 2019 to 2024: A concerning trend among anesthesia residents and a growing gender disparity.,"The fields of anesthesiology and pain medicine are experiencing significant changes driven by market forces and professional preferences. While demand for anesthesiologists is rising, pain medicine is facing a decline in fellowship applications. This study analyzed data from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) from 2019 to 2023, focusing on trends in fellowship applications to pain medicine programs. Additionally, preliminary data from the 2024 match cycle were examined. There has been a notable decrease in anesthesiology residents applying to pain medicine fellowships, with applications dropping from 351 in 2019 to 193 in 2023. The overall decline in anesthesia-based applicants to pain medicine fellowships was 45%, signaling the highest detriment among anesthesiology applicants compared to other specialties. Gender disparities have been prevalent, with the absolute number of female applicants decreasing every year since 2019. Additionally, the 2023 match saw a significant number of unfilled programs, with 35 out of 115 programs failing to fill all positions. Preliminary data from the 2024 match cycle suggest this downward trend is continuing. The decline in pain medicine fellowship applications, particularly among anesthesiology residents, signals potential future workforce shortages and challenges in patient care. Recruitment strategies should include early exposure to pain medicine during residency, enhanced mentorship programs, and robust recruitment efforts (including virtual options).

Digital Exclusion and Cognitive Function in Elderly Populations in Developing Countries: Insights Derived From 2 Longitudinal Cohort Studies.,"Cognition disorders not only lead to adverse health consequences but also contribute to a range of socioeconomic challenges and diminished capacity for performing routine daily activities. In the digital era, understanding the impact of digital exclusion on cognitive function is crucial, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the association between digital exclusion and cognitive function among elderly populations in developing countries. Using data from CHARLS (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) from 2011 to 2020 and MHAS (Mexican Health & Aging Study) from 2012 to 2021, we defined digital exclusion as self-reported absence from the internet. Cognitive function was assessed through 5 tests: orientation, immediate verbal recall, delayed verbal recall, serial 7s, and figure recall. Cognitive function was assessed in 2 categories: worse cognition (a categorical variable that classifies cognition as either better or worse compared to the entire cohort population) and cognitive scores (a continuous variable representing raw cognitive scores across multiple follow-up waves). Logistic regression analyses and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses were used to examine the relationship between cognitive function and digital exclusion, adjusting for potential confounders, including demographics, lifestyle factors, history of chronic diseases, basic activities of daily living (BADL) disability, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) disability, and basic cognitive abilities. After excluding participants with probable cognitive impairment at baseline and those who did not have a complete cognitive assessment in any given year (ie, all tests in the cognitive assessment must be completed in any follow-up wave), a total of 24,065 participants in CHARLS (n=11,505, 47.81%) and MHAS (n=12,560, 52.19%) were included. Of these, 96.78% (n=11,135) participants in CHARLS and 70.02% (n=8795) in MHAS experienced digital exclusion. Adjusted logistic regression analyses revealed that individuals with digital exclusion were more likely to exhibit worse cognitive performance in both CHARLS (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% CI 1.42-2.99; P<.001) and MHAS (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.26-1.55; P<.001). Gender and age did not significantly modify the relationship between digital exclusion and worse cognition (intervention P>.05). The fully adjusted mean differences in global cognitive scores between the 2 groups were 0.98 (95% CI 0.70-1.28; P<.001) in CHARLS and 0.50 (95% CI 0.40-0.59; P<.001) in MHAS. A substantial proportion of older adults, particularly in China, remain excluded from internet access. Our study examined longitudinal changes in cognitive scores and performed cross-sectional comparisons using Z-score standardization. The findings suggest that digital exclusion is linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline among older adults in developing countries. Promoting internet access may help mitigate this risk and support better cognitive health in these populations.","Duan Sainan, Chen Dongxu, Wang Jinping, Paramboor Mohammed Sharooq, Xia Zhen, Xu Wanting, Han Kun, Zhu Tao, Jiang Xiaoqin",Journal of medical Internet research,2024,39546790,PMC11607572,10.2196/56636,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39546790,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11607572,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Apple Vision Pro and Its Implications in Mohs Micrographic Surgery: A Narrative Review.,"Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is a precise and effective technique for treating skin cancers, necessitating high accuracy and real-time decision-making to ensure complete tumor removal while preserving healthy tissue. The introduction of the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), an advanced mixed-reality headset, presents a potential technological advancement in surgical practice. The present investigation explores the integration of AVP into Mohs surgery, focusing on its potential to enhance preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative analysis. The AVP's high-resolution displays, advanced eye-tracking technology, and real-time data overlay capabilities may assist in meticulous surgical planning and execution. In the preoperative phase, AVP enables the creation and manipulation of detailed 3D models, providing comprehensive visualizations of tumor margins and critical structures. During surgery, AVP's real-time data overlay aids in precise tumor excision and spatial orientation, reducing errors and improving outcomes. Postoperatively, the AVP facilitates detailed procedural reviews and serves as a robust educational tool for surgical trainees. Despite its promising applications, challenges such as real-time resolution limitations, potential eye strain from prolonged use, and high costs must be addressed for widespread clinical adoption. This review highlights the transformative potential of AVP in Mohs surgery and underscores the need for further research to optimize integration and maximize benefits in dermatological procedures.","Kaye Alan D, Islam Rahib K, Islam Kazi N, Khachemoune Amor, Haas Christopher, Barrie Sonnah, Pasqualucci Alberto, Shekoohi Sahar, Varrassi Giustino",Cureus,2024,39544562,PMC11560411,10.7759/cureus.71440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39544562,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11560411,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Importance of Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) Emitter Configuration for Clostridioides difficile Attenuation.,"The impact of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) emitter configuration on pathogen attenuation has not been assessed. We hypothesized that emitter configuration would impact UV-C efficacy for <i>Clostridioides difficile </i>(<i>C. difficile</i>) attenuation. <i>C. difficile</i> carriers (ReadyNow<sup>TM</sup> Test Carriers, Stratix Labs Corporation, Saint Paul, MN) inoculated with > 10<sup>8</sup> <i>C. difficile</i> American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 43593 (according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 3135 standards) were obtained, and the following experiments were conducted from April to August of 2023. Each of the three carriers along with three calibrated radiometers (ILT1270, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA) were mounted on an aluminum stand at positions A (left of center of stand), B (center of stand), and C (right of center of stand). The stand was positioned at 9 feet (2.74 m) from and directly ahead of UV-C emitters utilizing low-pressure mercury gas UV-C lamps (Surfacide, Waukesha, WI). Five UV-C emitter configurations were assessed; (1) three emitters with a triangular configuration about the stand and each rotating 360 degrees, (2) one emitter facing the stand and rotating 360 degrees, (3) three emitters facing the stand in a linear configuration and each rotating 5 degrees, (4) one emitter facing the stand and rotating 5 degrees, and (5) one emitter facing the stand and rotating 90 degrees. Three serial experiments were conducted. The first experiment used a dose titration curve to identify the minimally effective irradiation dose (mean and standard deviation mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) to achieve no growth (6-log reduction) in <i>C. difficile</i> counts with direct irradiation exposure. The second experiment involved assessing the relative efficacy of the five emitter configurations with the use of the minimally effective dose in attenuating polycarbonate <i>C. difficile</i> carriers positioned at 25.5 and 69.5 inches (64.77 to 176.53 cm) from the floor and oriented vertically to the emitters. The third experiment evaluated the relative efficacy of the five configurations for polycarbonate and textured plastic <i>C. difficile</i> carriers positioned at 25.5 or 58.5 inches (64.77 to 148.59 cm) from the floor and with a 45-degree or horizontal orientation to the emitters. We assessed residual anaerobic bacterial contamination for three intensive care unit (ICU) rooms to ascertain clinical applications of study results. The minimally effective dose for polycarbonate <i>C. diff</i>icile carriers with direct exposure was 432.28 ± 2.12 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Configurations one through five achieved a > 4-log reduction when the minimally effective dose was delivered to polycarbonate <i>C. difficile</i> carriers that were positioned at 9 feet from the emitters, 25.5 or 69.5 inches from the floor, and with vertical orientation to the emitters. When <i>C. difficile</i> carriers were changed to textured plastic, orientation to the emitters was changed to horizontal or 45 degrees, and height from the floor was changed to 25.5 and 58.5 inches, the log reductions achieved by configuration one through five were 1.61, 0.61, 0.79, 1.15, and 0.98, respectively, with configuration one achieving a greater log reduction than two (P = 0.0137). In each of the three ICU rooms, at least one of nine sampled locations returned ≥ 500 anaerobic CFU, indicating the need for at least a 0.7-log reduction (500 to 99 CFU).

Efficacy of high-frequency rTMS in the treatment of gait disorder and cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease based on wearable devices and eye-movement assessments.,"Postural instability and gait disorder and cognitive dysfunction are common symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Scale assessment is frequently used in the clinic to evaluate PD, but this technique is limited by its lack of sensitivity to changes in disease progression and its difficulty in capturing subtle movements and changes in cognitive function. It is currently believed that high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve motor and cognitive dysfunction in patients with PD, though it remains controversial. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor and dynamically identify changes in postural instability and gait disorder, as well as those in cognitive dysfunction, in PD to develop targeted interventions. In this study, we observed the effect of high-frequency rTMS on gait disorders and cognitive functions in patients with PD by comparing data from wearable devices and eye-tracking devices before and after treatment. A total of 159 patients with PD were included in this study. A GYENNO MATRIX wearable gait analyzer was used to monitor the objective gait data (including the timed up-and-go, narrow-track, and turning tests), the Eyeknow eye-tracking evaluation system was used to monitor the patient's eye movement cognition data (including the smooth pursuit, pro-saccade, and anti-saccade tests), and gait and cognitive function-related scales, including the Tinetti Balance Scale, Tinetti Gait Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), were evaluated at the same time before and after high-frequency rTMS treatment. The mean step length, mean stride velocity, stride length, and mean step frequency of patients with PD in the timed up-and-go test all increased compared with those before rTMS treatment, whereas the mean stride time and double support decreased. In the narrow-track test, the mean stride velocity increased and the mean stride time decreased. In the turning test, the turning left duration, turning right duration, mean duration, mean number of steps, and average step duration decreased, while the mean angular velocity increased after rTMS treatment. Compared with those before rTMS treatment, the latency period of patients with PD in overlapping saccades decreased, the completion time of overlapping saccades decreased, and the average saccade speed increased. In the anti-saccade test, the completion time decreased and the average saccade speed increased after rTMS treatment. Compared with those before rTMS treatment, the Tinetti Balance Scale, Tinetti Gait Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and MoCA scores increased, and the MoCA sub-items improved in terms of visual-spatial and executive function, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation after rTMS treatment. High-frequency rTMS may be an effective therapy for improving gait disorders and cognitive functions in patients with PD.","Tang Hong Yin, Liao XiangLian, Li Peng, Zhang Pengfei, Yao Jian, Xing Yilan, Zhao Xin, He Xuying, Zan Jie, Li Guihua",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2024,39478696,PMC11521881,10.3389/fnagi.2024.1480171,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39478696,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11521881,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The impact of current pediatric anesthesiology fellows shortfall on freestanding children's hospitals and practices.,"The pediatric anesthesiology workforce is currently facing a critical shortage, which will have significant consequences for patient care and the healthcare system as a whole. The workforce is aging, and despite increasing numbers of anesthesiology residents, fewer graduates are entering the field of pediatrics. It should also be noted that fewer medical school graduates are entering pediatrics as well. This situation raises concerns about the availability of specialists and the training of future physicians. To address this shortage, a comprehensive strategy is urgently needed, including outreach, mentorship, financial incentives, and policy changes to attract and retain new talent in pediatric anesthesiology.

Preparing for Virtual Interviews: A Pilot Study to Understand the Needs of Interviewees.,"Virtual interviews play a crucial role in the ranking process. National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) data shows a median number of 23.5 interviews per applicant.

Factors influencing the choice of specialization - a cross-sectional study with civilian medical students and prospective medical officers in Germany.,"The recruitment of physicians is an increasing challenge. The aim of the study was to explore factors that might influence future civilian and military doctors' choice of specialization. A 28 item author developed questionnaire was used to survey civilian medical students and prospective medical officers. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items addressing choice of specialization, and eight socio-demographic factors. Response options were available in the form of open and closed questions as well as in the form of a Likert scale (1 'not at all' to 6 'very much'). The questionnaire was completed online by prospective medical officer from June to September 2021 and by civilian students from November 2020 to March 2021. In total, 2,030 students (56.1% female, mean age = 24, mean semester 6.5) participated in the survey, 1,553 civilian students and 477 prospective medical officers. Regular feedback and clear structures (mean = 5.35) followed by good teamwork (mean = 5.33) during postgraduate training was rated particularly important. Moreover, a secure job after graduation (mean = 5.23) and a compatibility of family and job (mean = 5.14) were important parameters for career choice. The specializations most frequently chosen were surgery (32.0%), internal medicine (27.1%) and anesthesiology (22.1%). The regression models showed that the choice depends on own attitude concerning the specialty would be a patient-orientation job, or a job with more manual work or more career option within in the job preferred. Considering the value students place on receiving feedback and the structure of their specialist training, this seems to be a promising strategy for future recruitment. Good team dynamics and job security are key concerns for prospective physicians.","Goetz Katja, Grienitz Katharina, Steinhäuser Jost",BMC medical education,2024,39420325,PMC11488281,10.1186/s12909-024-06173-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39420325,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11488281,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Risk of infections among persons treated with opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.,"Millions of persons with chronic pain across North America and Europe use opioids. While the immunosuppressive properties of opioids are associated with risks of infections, these outcomes could be mitigated through careful patient selection and monitoring practices when appropriate. It is important to recognise that some patients do benefit from a carefully tailored opioid therapy. Enough primary studies have been published to date regarding the role of opioids in potential immunosuppression presenting as an increased rate of infection acquisition, infectious complications and mortality. There is thus a critical need for a consensus in this area. The methodology is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, the MOOSE Guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We plan to systematically search Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMB Review, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar databases from their inception date to December 2023. Full-text primary studies that report measurable outcomes in adults with chronic pain, all routes of opioid use, all types of infections and all settings will be included. We will identify a scope of reported infections and the evidence on the association of opioid use (including specific opioid, dosage, formulation and duration of use) with the risk of negative infectious outcomes. Opioid use-associated outcomes, comparing opioid use with another opioid or a non-opioid medication, will be reported. The meta-analysis will incorporate individual risk factors. If data are insufficient, the results will be synthesised narratively. Publication bias and confounding evaluation will be performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework will be used. Approval for the use of published data is not required. The results will be published, presented at conferences and discussed in deliberative dialogue groups.

Differential neuromotor control of the vertical and longitudinal genioglossus muscle fibers: An overlooked tongue retractor.,"The genioglossus (GG) is known to be the main tongue protrusor, and therefore plays a major role in breathing. However, due to the fan shape of the GG fibers, it could be assumed that contraction of the anterior fibers of the GG do not cause tongue protrusion. In this study, we examined the effect of contraction of the anterior-vertical fibers of the GG (GG<sub>V</sub>) on the tongue and their EMG activity during wakefulness and sleep. The findings were compared to those of the longitudinal fibers (GG<sub>L</sub>), which, based on their orientation, are responsible for tongue protrusion. Fine-wire electrode pairs were placed into the GG<sub>V</sub> and GG<sub>L</sub> in 11 patients with untreated OSA. Movement of the tongue during electrical stimulation at each site was videoed. The same electrodes were used to record EMG from both sites during respiratory stimulation by inspiratory loading and CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing during wakefulness. During sleep, repetitive flow limitation events were induced with low-level CPAP to augment GG activity. In all participants, electrical stimulation of GG<sub>L</sub> and GG<sub>V</sub> protruded and retracted the tongue, respectively. Respiratory stimulation increased GG activity, but GG<sub>V</sub> reached only 39 % and 23 % of peak GG<sub>L</sub> activity during high resistive loading and PCO<sub>2</sub> of 65 mmHg, respectively. Flow limitation during sleep increased GG<sub>L</sub> to levels that were considerably higher than awake baseline, but GG<sub>V</sub> activity remained tonic or with minimal phasic activity, reaching on average 15 % of GG<sub>L</sub> peak activity. Our electrical stimulation findings indicate that GG<sub>V</sub> is a tongue retractor and depressor. Tongue stimulation for OSA should avoid this area. The EMG results demonstrate that the anterior part of the GG is controlled very differently from the longitudinal protrusive fibers. The GG<sub>V</sub> responses are similar to those previously found in tongue retractors and peri-pharyngeal muscles other than the GG, in which diminished activation during sleep is likely to be involved in the failure of increasing GG<sub>L</sub> activity to alleviate flow limitation.","Oliven Ron, Oliven Arie, Somri Mostafa, Schwartz Alan R, Hardak Emilia",Respiratory physiology & neurobiology,2025,39389523,,10.1016/j.resp.2024.104354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39389523,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Acceptability of the power over pain portal among patients awaiting tertiary care consultation: A qualitative study of patients' perceptions.,"Chronic pain affects approximately 7.6 million Canadians and access to care remains an issue. The Power Over Pain (POP) Portal offers immediate access to evidence-based resources ranging from low- (e.g. education, self-management), to high- (e.g. individual counseling) intensity. We explored the POP Portal's acceptability, usability, and perceived usefulness among patients newly referred to a tertiary care pain clinic. We used a descriptive, qualitative approach with a prospective cohort of 60 adult patients recently referred to The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic. Patients were offered an orientation session and asked to participate in a seven-week follow-up interview. Data were thematically analyzed in an iterative process, whereby responses were reviewed and coded by two members of the research team. Of the 60 patients referred to the POP Portal by clinic clerks, 45 participated in the orientation session, and 40 completed a four-week follow-up. All 40 patients had used the POP Portal and recommended that we continue to offer the POP Portal to patients awaiting care. We identified overarching themes of acceptability (five subthemes), usability (ten subthemes), accessibility (three subthemes), and patient value of the POP Portal (three subthemes).

You are safe here: A flyer with re-orientating messages for families of patients with delirium in the intensive care unit.,"Patients in delirium require trustful communication and re-orientation. We developed a flyer with positive, re-orientating suggestions for families of delirious patients in intensive care units. Suggestions include creating a safe environment, interpreting unusual behaviours positively and fostering mental resilience. Additionally, families are encouraged to prioritize their own well-being, recognizing their crucial role in supporting their loved ones. This flyer offers practical strategies across four key areas: ensuring security and orientation, reframing noises and body experiences, managing agitation and reshaping perceptions. By equipping families with knowledge and tools, this resource aims to promote understanding, resilience and strength to humanize delirium care.","Nydahl Peter, Chahdi Mohamed, Debue Anne-Sophie, Deffner Teresa, Galazzi Alessandro, Gallie Louise, La-Calle Gabriel Heras, Krotsetis Susanne, Lewko Agnieszka, Lindroth Heidi, Liu Keibun, Paulino Maria Carolina, Prigge Arvid, van den Boogaard Mark, von Haken Rebecca",Nursing in critical care,2024,39362828,,10.1111/nicc.13169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39362828,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The impact of intersectionality on the experience of medical trainees.,"Diverse trainees have different training experiences than non-diverse trainees; however, it has not been demonstrated if the number of diverse traits (DTs) (i.e. intersectionality) contributes to worse experiences. Our objective was to understand if the number of DTs a trainee has impacts their training experience. We distributed a survey to medical trainees at Mass General Brigham from 15/12/23 to 15/4/24. DTs were based on race/ethnicity, gender-identity, sexual orientation, birthplace, disability, and highest parental education. A total of 134 responses were obtained. Respondents with 1 DT were more likely to report dissatisfaction with the quality of their training compared to those with 0 DT (P = 0.03). However, this did not remain true for those with 2 or 3+ DT (P = 0.39, P = 0.59). Only respondents with 1 DT disagreed that they had similar opportunities for academic success to those of their peers (P = 0.03) and agreed that they had to work harder than others to be valued equally (P < 0.01). Respondents with 3+ DTs felt that their institution was not diverse (P < 0.01) and racist (P < 0.01) compared to respondents with zero DTs. Therefore, trainees with DTs had different training experiences than trainees with zero DTs, but the number of DTs did not consistently correlate with the quality of their experience. We believe this data is important for administrators to understand how intersectionality effects the trainee experience. Additionally, we believe this data can be used to gauge disparities in education and create an avenue to address issues, such as discrimination, microaggressions, and low retention rate of diverse applicants.","Walker Zachary, Murphy Ellen, Sain Cody, Ohiomoba Ramael, Lasic Morana, Lanes Andrea, Ginsburg Elizabeth",Postgraduate medical journal,2025,39357880,,10.1093/postmj/qgae130,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39357880,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Global, regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk factors, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

Modeling electrical impedance in brain tissue with diffusion tensor imaging for functional neurosurgery applications.,"<i>Objective.</i>Decades ago, neurosurgeons used electrical impedance measurements in the brain for coarse intraoperative tissue differentiation. Over time, these techniques were largely replaced by more refined imaging and electrophysiological localization. Today, advanced methods of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and finite element method (FEM) modeling may permit non-invasive, high-resolution intracerebral impedance prediction. However, expectations for tissue-impedance relationships and experimentally verified parameters for impedance modeling in human brains are lacking. This study seeks to address this need.<i>Approach.</i>We used FEM to simulate high-resolution single- and dual-electrode impedance measurements along linear electrode trajectories through (1) canonical gray and white matter tissue models, and (2) selected anatomic structures within whole-brain patient DTI-based models. We then compared intraoperative impedance measurements taken at known locations along deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgical trajectories with model predictions to evaluate model accuracy and refine model parameters.<i>Main results.</i>In DTI-FEM models, single- and dual-electrode configurations performed similarly. While only dual-electrode configurations were sensitive to white matter fiber orientation, other influences on impedance, such as white matter density, enabled single-electrode impedance measurements to display significant spatial variation even within purely white matter structures. We compared 308 intraoperative single-electrode impedance measurements in five DBS patients to DTI-FEM predictions at one-to-one corresponding locations. After calibration of model coefficients to these data, predicted impedances reliably estimated intraoperative measurements in all patients (R=0.784±0.116,n=5). Through this study, we derived an updated value for the slope coefficient of the DTI conductance model published by Tuch<i>et al</i>,k=0.0649 S⋅smm-3 (originalk=0.844), for use specifically in humans at physiological frequencies.<i>Significance.</i>This is the first study to compare impedance estimates from imaging-based models of human brain tissue to experimental measurements at the same locations<i>in vivo</i>. Accurate, non-invasive, imaging-based impedance prediction has numerous applications in functional neurosurgery, including tissue mapping, intraoperative electrode localization, and DBS.","Kumar Niranjan, Ahamparam Aidan, Lu Charles W, Malaga Karlo A, Patil Parag G",Journal of neural engineering,2024,39303746,,10.1088/1741-2552/ad7db2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39303746,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Comparison of Conventional Rotating Method and Non-Rotating Method for Double-Lumen Tube Insertion Using a Customized Rigid J-Shaped Stylet for One-Lung Ventilation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<b>Background</b>: The conventional double-lumen tube (DLT) insertion method requires a rotatory maneuver that was developed using direct laryngoscopy and may not be optimal for video laryngoscopy. This study compared a new non-rotatory maneuver with the conventional method for DLT insertion using video laryngoscopy. <b>Methods</b>: Patients scheduled for thoracic surgery requiring one-lung ventilation were randomly assigned to either the rotating (R) or non-rotating (NR) method groups. All patients were intubated using a customized rigid J-shaped stylet, a video laryngoscope, and a left-sided silicone DLT. The conventional rotatory maneuver was performed in the R group. In the NR group, the stylet was inserted with its tip oriented anteriorly (12 o'clock direction) while maintaining the bronchial lumen towards the left (9 o'clock direction). After reaching the glottic opening, the tube was inserted using a non-rotatory maneuver, maintaining the initial orientation. The primary endpoint was the intubation time. Secondary endpoints included first-trial success rate, sore throat, hoarseness, and airway injury. <b>Results</b>: Ninety patients (forty-five in each group) were included. The intubation time was significantly shorter in the NR group compared to the R group (22.0 [17.0, 30.0] s vs. 28.0 [22.0, 34.0] s, respectively), with a median difference of 6 s (95% confidence interval [CI], 3-11 s; <i>p</i> = 0.017). The NR group had a higher first-attempt success rate and a lower incidence of sore throats. <b>Conclusions</b>: The non-rotatory technique with video laryngoscopy significantly reduced intubation time and improved first-attempt success rate, offering a viable and potentially superior alternative to the conventional rotatory technique.","Lee Soomin, Han Sung Joon, Park Jiho, Kim Yoon-Hee, Hong Boohwi, Oh Chahyun, Yoon Seok-Hwa",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,39274515,PMC11396204,10.3390/jcm13175302,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39274515,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11396204,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
An Evaluation of the Transfer of Skills and Knowledge from Two World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists Fellowship Programs.,"Subspecialist training is an important part of developing human resources for health and for some learners, may require taking place in another, higher-resourced country. Despite effective learning of skills and knowledge in a different, more highly resourced context, transfer of these skills and knowledge back to a more poorly resourced context can be a challenge. We aimed to evaluate the transfer of skills and knowledge in 2 World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) fellowship programs. This qualitative program evaluation study, guided by Guskey's evaluation framework, used in-depth interviews of both faculty and graduates of the 2 fellowship programs. Interviews were conducted remotely, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using qualitative content and pattern analysis. We interviewed 2 administrators, 10 faculty members, 17 graduated fellows, and 3 graduated fellows now in the role of faculty member in that fellowship. Key themes were barriers and enablers to the transfer of skills, including workplace and staffing, resources, mentorship, the interprofessional team, and leadership. Graduated fellows were able to have an impact on returning home in the areas of practice and service development, research, and teaching. Our study found that the 2 fellowship programs had variable success in the transfer of learned skills and knowledge back to the fellows' ""home"" institutions. Contextual differences between the fellowship institution and the home institution were the main source of barriers to transfer, and fellows from different countries had diverse needs. Supporting the transfer of knowledge and skills should be an explicit goal of these fellowship programs, and as such, should be considered in the recruitment of fellows, curriculum development, and in how the success of a fellowship is evaluated. Curricula should not just focus on medical knowledge and skills, but also skills in leading change and in education.","Bould M Dylan, Cousins J Bradley, Hoang Jenny, Zha Yuanting, Yilma Lydia, Gacii V Mark, Subramanian Balavenkat, Evans Faye M",Anesthesia and analgesia,2024,39259693,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006923,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39259693,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Subspecialist training in another, higher-resourced country, with a focus on transfer of skills and knowledge back to a more poorly resourced context",Graduates of the 2 World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) fellowship programs,"Graduated fellows are expected to have an impact on returning home in the areas of practice and service development, research, and teaching"
Gender and Race/Ethnicity dynamics in anesthesiology mentorship: results of a European survey.,"Mentorship is crucial to career advancement, medical education, and psychosocial support, especially for women and minorities. Although anesthesia mentoring programs have shown promise, there are no survey data regarding mentor-mentee relationship dynamics. This study aimed to explore the dynamics of the anesthesia mentor/mentee relationship. A open cross-sectional web-based survey was distributed by the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care and European Society of Regional Anesthesia to European anesthesiologists. Participation was anonymous and consent was obtained. The study evaluated responses relating to preferences, facilitators, and barriers to mentorship relationships along with sociodemographic information. In total, 543 anesthesiologists responded to the survey, and 406 (111 mentees, 49 mentors, 193 both, 53 neither) responded to questions regarding mentorship. 184 anesthesiologists identified as woman and 22 as other genders (non-binary, transgender, gender-fluid, and self-described gender). Moreover, 250 anesthesiologists identified as white. Both mentors and mentees indicated that personal compatibility was the most important factor for successful mentorship. Barriers to mentorship included time consumption and perceived lack of interest from the mentor and mentee. Both mentors and mentees benefited from this relationship. The former reported feeling helpful, and the latter supported the development of clinical skills. The mentors indicated that their participation was important for protecting against burnout/exhaustion and impostor syndrome. Participants reported a preference for mentorship programs organized at the departmental level, offered at the start of the anesthesiology education curricula. Women were more likely to feel a 'lack of interest' in mentoring them as a barrier (OR = 2.49, P = 0.033). Gender was a barrier for mentors of other genders (OR = 23.9, P = 0.0027) and ethnicity (OR = 48.0, P = 0.0023). White mentees found gender (OR = 0.14, P = 0.021) and ethnicity (OR = 0.11, P = 0.048) to be less important barriers to successful mentorship relationship. When possible, programs should prioritize matching mentors and mentees based on personal compatibility and experience in the mentee's area of interest. Addressing the perceived lack of interest in mentoring is essential for promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion within anesthesiology, as well as and uplifting women and minorities.

Surface Cleaning with a Microfiber Cloth and Water followed by Ultraviolet-C Light Exposure Achieves Non-Inferior Disinfection of a Pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus Strain versus Use of Germicidal Wipes.,"We hypothesized that ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation (Surfacide, Waukesha, WI) following use of microfiber cloths (Sanny Shop LLC, Longmont, CO) soaked in water would be noninferior to surface disinfection wipes containing a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol (PDI Healthcare, Woodcliff Lake, NJ) for the pathogenic <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) sequence type 5 (ST5). This was a randomized laboratory study of disinfection approaches for <i>S. aureus</i> ST5. A total of 270 polycarbonate slides loaded with ST5 were prepared for the standard surface disinfection group (N=18) and water-soaked microfiber cloths and UV-C treatment group (N=144), along with positive and negative microbiological controls. All 18 samples of <i>S. aureus</i> ST5 bacteria treated with standard chemical wipes showed complete disinfection (colony forming units (CFU) = 0). All 144 treatments with water-soaked microfiber wipes followed by UV-C exposure showed complete disinfection (CFU =0) regardless of soiling, height from the floor, or orientation to the emitters. The upper 95% exact one-sided confidence limit for any CFU >0 was 2.1%. These data affirm our hypothesis that surface wiping with a damp cloth followed by triangular UV-C irradiation delivery is noninferior to surface disinfection for <i>S. aureus</i> ST5 using germicidal wipes, even when UV-C is compromised by height from the floor and orientation to the emitters and surface disinfection is targeted. Removing bioburden with chemical-free microfiber cloths followed by triangular UV-C delivery is a noninferior strategy to targeted surface disinfection with chemical disinfecting wipes for the pathogenic <i>S. aureus</i> ST5 strain in the laboratory setting.","Gibbons Stephanie, Dexter Franklin, Loftus Randy W, Wanta Brendan T, Brindeiro Carmen T, Hwang Soyun M, Charnin Jonathan E",Cureus,2024,39221375,PMC11365582,10.7759/cureus.65963,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39221375,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11365582,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The value of endocervical curettage during large loop excision of the transformation zone in combination with endocervical surgical margin in predicting persistent/recurrent dysplasia of the uterine cervix: a retrospective study.,"Cervical cancer often originates from cervical cell dysplasia. Previous studies mainly focused on surgical margins and high-risk human papillomavirus persistence as factors predicting recurrence. New research highlights the significance of positive findings from endocervical curettage (ECC) during excision treatment. However, the combined influence of surgical margin and ECC status on dysplasia recurrence risk has not been investigated. In this retrospective study, data from 404 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) who underwent large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) were analyzed. Records were obtained retrospectively from the hospital's patient database including information about histopathological finding from ECC, endocervical margin status with orientation of residual disease after LLETZ, recurrent/persistent dysplasia after surgical treatment and need for repeated surgery (LLETZ or hysterectomy). Patients with cranial (= endocervical) R1-resection together with cells of HSIL in the ECC experienced re-surgery 17 times. With statistical normal distribution, this would have been expected to happen 5 times (p < 0.001). The Fisher's exact test confirmed a statistically significant connection between the resection status together with the result of the ECC and the reoccurrence of dysplasia after surgery (p < 0,001). 40,6% of the patients with re-dysplasia after primary LLETZ had shown cranial R1-resection together with cells of HSIL in the ECC. Investigating the risk for a future abnormal Pap smear, patients with cranial R1-resection together with dysplastic cells in the ECC showed the greatest deviation of statistical normal distribution with SR = 2.6. Our results demonstrate that the future risk of re-dysplasia, re-surgery, and abnormal Pap smear for patients after LLETZ due to HSIL is highest within patients who were diagnosed with cranial (endocervical) R1-resection and with cells of HSIL in the ECC in their primary LLETZ. Consequently, the identification of patients, who could benefit of intensified observation or required intervention could be improved.","Scherer-Quenzer Anne Cathrine, Findeis Jelena, Herbert Saskia-Laureen, Yokendren Nithya, Reinhold Ann-Kristin, Schlaiss Tanja, Wöckel Achim, Diessner Joachim, Kiesel Matthias",BMC women's health,2024,39169335,PMC11337847,10.1186/s12905-024-03291-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39169335,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11337847,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Designing Novel Physiologic Monitor Displays for Combat Medics.,"Combat medics who are responsible for the care of injured warfighters face challenges from their reliance on medical alarms that exceed the noise levels recommended by the WHO. This is because the elevated noise levels in military facilities, particularly from vehicular units and weaponry, compromise the combat medics' effectiveness and attentiveness to medical alarms. We previously designed a graphical (""configural"") display to communicate patients' vital signs and found that when the configural display and traditional numerical display were concurrently presented to participants, it produced the fastest identification of patient vital signs and triggered the fewest number of alarms. This study used eye tracking to assess how participants direct visual attention to and engage with concurrently presented numerical and configural vital sign displays. We recruited 30 undergraduate students with normal hearing and vision for this study. Subjects were tasked with monitoring a simulated patient's vital signals using simultaneously presented numerical and configural vital sign displays. Concurrently, they performed an N-back task to simulate the multitasking required in a military environment. We manipulated the eccentricity and display position of the numerical and configural displays through 4 orientations, with each orientation being used in a monitoring block lasting 12 minutes. Continuous eye tracking was utilized to collect physiological data about participant display preference. We used eye tracking to analyze several metrics: Total display viewing time, total viewing time percentage, number of dwells (groups of eye fixations), mean fixations per dwell, and fixation patterns during an emergency event. Participants spent more time looking at the configural display than the numerical display during nominal monitoring and emergency events. During emergencies, the percentage of time individuals spent looking at the configural display increased from 30 to 50%, while there was no corresponding increase in the participants' looking at the numerical display. When there were 2 concurrent emergency events instead of 1, total viewing time did not increase, suggesting that participants did not need to change their viewing strategy when the emergency situation complexity increased. Also, during emergencies, participants directed nearly half of their fixations to the configural display during the first 2 seconds of an emergency, while only directing fewer than 5% of fixations to the numerical display during that same period. The average response time for an emergency event was around 2 seconds, which suggests that participants obtained relevant information from the configural display in this time period. We found that when a patient monitor contains both a configural display and a numerical display, participants look at the configural display. Furthermore, during time-sensitive situations, participants utilize the configural display to provide important information. We suggest this because the configural display integrates the relevant vital signs into one display. These findings provide justification for pursuing integrated vital sign displays to efficiently communicate patient conditions in complex environments. On the battlefield, swift decision-making is essential, as combat medics must minimize the time required to assess and act in critical situations.","Cummins Mabel L, Yang Sean, Sicard Caroline, Shive Joshua, Schlesinger Joseph J",Military medicine,2024,39160889,,10.1093/milmed/usae183,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39160889,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Endotracheal tube cuff position in relationship to the walls of the trachea: A retrospective computed tomography-based analysis.,"The use of cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETTs) has become the standard of care in pediatric practice. The rationale for the use of a cuffed ETT is to minimize pressure around the cricoid while providing an effective airway seal. However, safe care requires that the cuff lie distal to the cricoid ring following endotracheal intubation. The current study demonstrates the capability of computed tomography (CT) imaging in identifying the position of the cuff of the ETT in intubated patients. The study included patients ranging in age from 1 month to 10 years who underwent neck and chest CT imaging that required general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. The location of the ETT and of the cuff within the airway was determined from axial CT images at three levels (proximal, middle, and distal). Anatomical orientations were tabulated, and percent chances of each orientation were determined for the ETT and the cuff. The study cohort included 42 patients ranging in age from 1 to 114 months. An ETT with a polyvinylchloride cuff was used in 24 patients, and an ETT with a polyurethane cuff was used in 18 patients. The ETT was located near the posterior wall of the trachea in approximately 24-38% of patients, being most likely to be centrally located at the proximal end and at its mid-portion. The middle part of the cuff was most likely to be positioned in the mid-portion of the trachea but tended to skew anteriorly at both the proximal and distal ends. This is the first study using CT imaging to identify the uniformity of cuff inflation within the trachea in children. With commonly used cuffed ETTs, cuff inflation and the final position of ETT cuff within the tracheal lumen were not uniform. Future investigations are needed to determine the reasons for this asymmetry and its clinical implications.","Wani Tariq M, Siddique Ayesha Y, Khan Wajahat N, Rehman Saif, Tram Nguyen K, Tobias Joseph D",Saudi journal of anaesthesia,2024,39149725,PMC11323902,10.4103/sja.sja_36_24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39149725,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11323902,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effectiveness Assessment of Bispectral Index Monitoring Compared with Conventional Monitoring in General Anesthesia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<i>Background and Objective</i>. The Bispectral Index (BIS) is utilized to guide the depth of anesthesia monitoring during surgical procedures. However, conflicting results regarding the benefits of BIS for depth of anesthesia monitoring have been reported in numerous studies.

Clinical trial registers and grey literature were also searched, and reference lists of included studies, as well as related review articles, were manually reviewed. <i>Selection Criteria</i>. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials without gender or age restrictions. The control groups used conventional monitoring, while the intervention groups utilized BIS monitoring. The exclusion criteria included duplicates, reviews, animal studies, unclear outcomes, and incomplete data. <i>Data Collection and Analysis</i>. Two independent reviewers screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality, with analyses conducted using R 4.0 software. <i>Main Results</i>. Forty studies were included. In comparison to the conventional depth of anesthesia monitoring, BIS monitoring reduced the postoperative cognitive dysfunction risk (RR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73∼0.99, <i>P</i> = 0.04), shortened the eye-opening time (MD = -1.34, 95% CI: -2.06∼-0.61, <i>P</i> < 0.01), orientation recovery time (MD = -1.99, 95% CI: -3.62∼-0.36, <i>P</i> = 0.02), extubation time (MD = -2.54, 95% CI: -3.50∼-1.58, <i>P</i> < 0.01), and postanesthesia care unit stay time (MD = -7.11, 95% CI: -12.67∼-1.55, <i>P</i> = 0.01) and lowered the anesthesia drug dosage (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.63∼-0.15, <i>P</i> < 0.01). <i>Conclusion</i>. BIS can be used to effectively monitor the depth of anesthesia. Its use in general anesthesia enhances the effectiveness of both patient care and surgical procedures.","Gu Yichun, Hao Jiajun, Wang Jiangna, Liang Peng, Peng Xinyi, Qin Xiaoxiao, Zhang Yunwei, He Da",Anesthesiology research and practice,2024,39149130,PMC11325011,10.1155/2024/5555481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39149130,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11325011,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Glass Ceiling in Global Health: Perspectives of Female and Male Anesthesiologists.,"Gender equity is essential for improving health outcomes globally. Despite comprising 75% of the global health workforce and dominating academic global health programs, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions in global health organizations. Our study aimed to identify potential gender differences in the beliefs and attitudes regarding barriers that women anesthesiologists encounter in pursuing careers and leadership roles in global health and to identify recommendations for improving gender equity in global health. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey focusing on career leadership opportunities and challenges uniquely faced by women clinicians in global health. We obtained permission from the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists to distribute our questionnaire to their leadership committee members during 2 months (May-July 2022). The questionnaire was distributed to 164 study participants with 67 individuals (44.8% female) based in 38 different countries completing the survey (response rate 40.9%). Overall, 47.8% of the participants aspired to a leadership position in global health and 58.2% agreed women face unique barriers to global health leadership (70.0% of women compared to 48.6% of men; P = .081). Female gender (odds ratio [OR], 19.22, P = .004) and divorced marital status (OR, 746.26, P = .004) were positively associated and African ethnicity (OR, 0.002, P = .017) was negatively associated with the perception of gender bias in their career growth. The main challenges included balancing work and family responsibilities, lack of female mentors or role models, gender-based discrimination, and limited opportunities for career advancement. Men acknowledged these challenges but reported personally experiencing them to a lesser extent, particularly concerning lack of opportunities (P = .005), inadequate pay (P = .000), and lack of training (P = .000). Gender disparities exist in the pursuit of global health careers. This study underscored that more women than men perceive barriers in pursuing leadership roles in global health and that men generally encounter these obstacles to a lesser extent. Female representation in leadership positions could be supported through evidence-informed policies that promote work-life balance, improve mentorship, offer equal opportunities for career advancement and adequate pay, and combat gender-based discrimination.","Matejic Bojana, Nelson Brett D, Collins Lisa, Milenovic Miodrag S",Anesthesia and analgesia,2024,39137053,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000007142,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39137053,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Promotion of work-life balance, improved mentorship, offering equal opportunities for career advancement and adequate pay, and combating gender-based discrimination",Female anesthesiologists aspiring to leadership positions in global health,Increased female representation in leadership positions in global health
[Impacts of different anesthetic protocols on the speed and quality of postoperative resuscitation in patients undergoing painless gastroscopy].,"<b>Objective:</b> To estimate the impacts of different anesthetic protocols on the speed and quality of postoperative resuscitation in patients undergoing painless gastroscopy. <b>Methods:</b> This was a prospectively designed randomized control study that included 150 patients who underwent painless gastroscopy in Hainan Cancer Hospital affiliated to Hainan Medical College between April and December of 2023. All the patients, classified as American Society of Aneshesiologists (ASA) Grade Ⅰ or Ⅱ, were randomly divided into three groups with different anesthetic protocols, including propofol group (group P), remimazolam group (group R) and remimazolam with flumazenil group (group RF). There were eventually 50 patients in each group. The three groups of patients were compared for their resuscitation time and the time that they stayed in the resuscitation room (addressed as""room time""below). At 10 min and 20 min after resuscitation, each patient was tested for recognition ability (orientation score), walking ability and fine motor skill (including reaction speed, quick-click ability and visual memory), respectively, with possible adverse reactions recorded spontaneously, such as hypotension, dizziness, nausea and vomitus. <b>Results:</b> There were 29 males and 21 females in group P with an average age of (34±6) years, 27 males and 23 females in group R with an average age of (36±8) years, and 26 males and 24 females in group RF with an average age of (33±7) years, respectively. All examinations for each patient were successfully completed with no interruptions. The resuscitation time and room time of group RF were (47±15) s and (26±5) min,respectively, which were both shorter than those in either group R [(489±92) s and (35±6) min] or group P [(196±61) s and (31±7) min] (all <i>P</i><0.05). The orientation score of patients in group RF at 10 min after resuscitation was (79.0±10.5), which was significantly higher than that in group R (70.0±11.7) (<i>P</i><0.05). The patients' walking ability score of group RF at 10 min and 20 min after resuscitation were [(23.6±10.8), (48.0±4.5)], which were better than those in group R[(15.4±11.1), (47.6±4.8)] (both <i>P</i><0.05). The patients' reaction speed and quick-click scores of group RF were [(851.0±150.9), (547.0±114.0) ms] and [(758.0±73.2), (629.0±128.9) ms], which were better than those in either group R [(1 151.0±206.0), (732.0±135.1) ms], [(893.0±110.9), (765.8±125.8) ms] or group P [(985.0±225.3), (613.0±123.2) ms], [(831.0±87.7), (691.0±115.8) ms] (all <i>P</i><0.05). The incidence rate of hypotension in group P was 18% (9/50), higher than that in either Group R [4% (2/50)] or group RF [2% (1/50)] (all <i>P</i><0.05). The incidence rates of dizziness, nausea and vomitus were comparable among all the three groups with no statistical differences (all <i>P</i>>0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> In patients undergoing anesthesia with remazolam, the use of flumazenil can not only shorten the resuscitation time and the time that the patients need to stay in the resuscitation room, but also speed up the recovery of the patients' recognition, walking and fine motor skill abilities.","Jia Z, Cai R Z, Zhao C C, Zhou B, Tan Z M",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2024,39118341,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20240126-00203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39118341,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Underrepresented in Medicine Trainees' Sense of Belonging and Professional Identity Formation after Participation in the Leadership Education in Advancing Diversity Program.,"There are persistent structural barriers that threaten inclusion and retention of underrepresented in medicine (UIM) residents and fellows (trainees) as future faculty in academic medicine. We developed the Leadership Education in Advancing Diversity (LEAD) Program at a single, academic institution, to address these barriers through a 10-month longitudinal curriculum across Graduate Medical Education for trainees to develop leadership and scholarship skills in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Explore how participation in LEAD impacted UIM trainees' sense of belonging and professional identity formation in academic medicine as well as perceptions about pursuing a career in academic medicine and future leadership roles. Institutional Review Board-approved qualitative study in August 2020-August 2021 with individual, semi-structured interviews of UIM LEAD graduates from the first four cohorts (2017-2021). Data were analyzed by two authors using modified grounded theory. Fourteen UIM trainees were interviewed; seven themes emerged. Critical aspects of the program: 1) Creation of a community of shared DEI values, 2) Mentorship, 3) Role of allies. Results of the program: 4) Deepened appreciation of personal and professional identity as UIM, 5) Fostered belonging in academic medicine, 6) Appreciation of different careers in academic medicine and how to integrate DEI interests, and 7) Inspired trainees to pursue leadership roles. LEAD can serve as a model for other institutions that seek to support UIM trainees' sense of belonging, professional identity formation, and perceptions about pursuing careers in academic medicine and future leadership roles.","Yemane Lahia, Powell Carmin, Edwards Jeffrey, Shumba Takudzwa, Alvarez Al'ai, Bandstra Belinda, Brooks Michelle, Brown-Johnson Cati, Caceres Wendy, Dunn Tamara, Johnson Carrie, Perez Felipe D, Reece-Nguyen Travis, Thomas Reena P, Watkins Amelia C, Blankenburg Rebecca",Academic pediatrics,2025,39117029,,10.1016/j.acap.2024.08.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39117029,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Regulation mechanism of GPS2 on PGC-1α/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics in inflammation of acute lung injury.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) has been a hot topic in the field of critical care research in recent years. Mitochondrial dynamics consists of mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial fission. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key molecule that regulates mitochondrial fission, is important in the oxidative stress and inflammatory response to ALI. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a core protein that mediates mitochondrial biogenesis. G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) acts as a transcriptional cofactor with regulatory effects on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of PGC-1α/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics involved in ALI and to demonstrate the protective mechanism of GPS2 in regulating mitochondrial structure and function and inflammation in ALI. The ALI model was constructed using LPS-induced wild-type mice and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs). It was found that lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation were exacerbated in the mice ALI model and that mitochondrial structure and function were disrupted in HPMVECs. In vitro studies revealed that LPS led to the upregulated expression of Drp1 and the downregulated expression of PGC-1α and GPS2. Mitochondrial division was reduced and respiratory function was restored in Drp1 knockdown cells, which inhibited oxidative stress and inflammatory response. In addition, the overexpression of PGC-1α and GPS2 significantly inhibited the expression of Drp1, mitochondrial function was restored, and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammatory factor release. Moreover, the overexpression of GPS2 promoted the upregulated expression of PGC-1α. This mechanism was also validated in vivo, in which the low expression of GPS2 in mice resulted in the upregulated expression of Drp1 and the downregulated expression of PGC-1α, and further exacerbated LPS-induced ALI. In the present study, we also found that LPS-induced the downregulated expression of GPS2 may be associated with its increased degradation by the proteasome. Therefore, these findings revealed that GPS2 inhibited oxidative stress and inflammation by modulating PGC-1α/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics to alleviate LPS-induced ALI, which may provide a new approach to the therapeutic orientation for LPS-induced ALI.","Zhao Liang, Gu Changping, Zhang Yi, Yan Jie, Qiu Lei, Qin Xiaofeng, Wang Yuelan",International immunopharmacology,2024,39116501,,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112838,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39116501,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
American society for metabolic and bariatric surgery: intra-operative care pathway for minimally invasive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Clinical care pathways help guide and provide structure to clinicians and providers to improve healthcare delivery and quality. The Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Committee (QIPS) of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) has previously published care pathways for the performance of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and pre-operative care of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This current RYGB care pathway was created to address intraoperative care, defined as care occurring on the day of surgery from the preoperative holding area, through the operating room, and into the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). PubMed queries were performed from January 2001 to December 2019 and reviewed according to Level of Evidence regarding specific key questions developed by the committee. Evidence-based recommendations are made for care of patients undergoing RYGB including the pre-operative holding area, intra-operative management and performance of RYGB, and concurrent procedures.

The Landscape of Pain Medicine for Women Physicians: A Perspective.,"The gender bias in academic anesthesiology is well known. Women are not only a minority in the field but also underrepresented in leadership positions. Reported reasons for this underrepresentation include barriers to career advancement, lack of mentorship, and differences in compensation, among others. Interventional pain, a competitive procedural subspecialty of anesthesiology, sees the trickle-down effects of this disparity. According to a report from the ACGME that sorted medical subspecialties by number of female trainees, pain medicine ranked in the bottom quartile across all disciplines from 2008-2016. To better understand the landscape for women physicians in the field of pain medicine, we undertook this investigation to review the knowledge about the topic and what questions remain unanswered. This study is a review of the current literature and aims to summarize and describe the landscape of pain medicine for women physicians. All literature review and manuscript preparation took place at the Yale University School of Medicine. We performed a comprehensive search using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases for the combined terms ""gender disparity,"" ""pain medicine,"" and ""anesthesiology,"" limiting our search to the year 2000 onward for the most recent literature on the topic. Our initial search retrieved 38 articles. All relevant articles pertaining to this perspective piece were collated. The available literature is discussed below. Women are underrepresented in interventional pain. The grim scarcity of female pain physicians is unlikely to improve soon, since while the number of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education pain fellowship programs continues to grow, women trainees comprise only between 22-25% of all pain medicine fellows. Additionally, although studies have compared the numbers of male interventional pain faculty to their female counterparts in academic hospitals and shown the ratio to range from 71.84-82% to 18-28.52%, respectively, no studies have truly explored the landscape for women physicians in private practice. Patients prefer and have better experiences with physicians who are racially and ethnically like themselves. In fact, the preference for and the lack of female clinicians have been associated with delayed pursuit of care and adverse health outcomes. The consequences of the burnout and attrition caused by the gender disparity, especially in a field like pain medicine, cannot be understate. The review might not have been comprehensive, and relevant studies might not have been included. While the gender disparity in academia is well documented for both anesthesiology and pain medicine, the reasons for this disparity have not been fully explored. Moreover, it is also unknown whether the minority of female physicians who select pain medicine as a subspecialty gravitate toward an academic or a private-practice path. To address the existing gender disparity, it is necessary to explore the landscape of interventional pain medicine in both academic and private practices and understand pain physicians' beliefs and sentiments regarding their subspecialty.","Jankelovits Amanda, Chow Robert M, Rana Paragi, Rajput Kanishka",Pain physician,2024,39087969,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39087969,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Evaluation of the clinical effects of atropine in combination with remifentanil in children undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis.,"Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common cause of acute abdomen in children. Anesthesia significantly influences the surgical treatment of AA in children, making the scientific and effective selection of anesthetics crucial. To assess the clinical effect of atropine (ATR) in combination with remifentanil (REMI) in children undergoing surgery for AA. In total, 108 cases of pediatric AA treated between May 2020 and May 2023 were selected, 58 of which received ATR + REMI [research group (RG)] and 50 who received REMI [control group (CG)]. Comparative analyses were conducted on the time to loss of eyelash reflex, pain resolution time, recovery time from anesthesia, incidence of adverse events (AEs; respiratory depression, hypoxemia, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension), intraoperative responses (head shaking, limb activity, orientation recovery, safe departure time from the operating room), hemodynamic parameters [oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>), mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate], postoperative sedation score (Ramsay score), and pain level [the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Scale]. Compared with the CG, the RG showed significantly shorter time to loss of eyelash reflex, pain resolution, recovery from anesthesia, and safe departure from the operating room. Furthermore, the incidence rates of overall AEs (head shaking, limb activity, <i>etc.</i>) were lower, and influences on intraoperative hemodynamic parameters and stress response indexes were fewer. The Ramsay score at 30 min after extubation and the FLACC score at 60 min after extubation were significantly lower in the RG than in the CG. ATR + REMI is superior to REMI alone in children undergoing AA surgery, with a lower incidence of AEs, fewer influences on hemodynamics and stress responses, and better post-anesthesia recovery.","Li Yu-Juan, Chen Yong-Yan, Lin Xia-Lan, Zhang Wei-Zhi",World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,2024,39087103,PMC11287676,10.4240/wjgs.v16.i7.2065,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39087103,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11287676,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Characteristics of Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiac Arrests and Resuscitation Duration.,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) duration is associated with cardiac arrest survival. To describe characteristics associated with CPR duration among hospitalized children without return of circulation (ROC) (patient-level analysis) and determine whether hospital median CPR duration in patients without ROC is associated with survival (hospital-level analysis). This retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing pediatric in-hospital CPR between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2021, used data from the Get With the Guidelines-Resuscitation registry. Children receiving chest compressions for at least 2 minutes and/or defibrillation were included in the patient-level analysis. For the hospital-level analysis, sites with at least 20 total events and at least 5 events without ROC were included. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2022, to November 15, 2023. For the patient-level analysis, the exposure was CPR duration in patients without ROC. For the hospital-level analysis, the exposure was quartile of median CPR duration in events without ROC at each hospital. For the patient-level analysis, outcomes were patient and event factors, including race and ethnicity and event location; we used a multivariable hierarchical linear regression model to assess factors associated with CPR duration in patients without ROC. For the hospital-level analysis, the main outcome was survival to discharge among all site events; we used a random intercept multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to examine the association between hospital quartile of CPR duration and survival to discharge. Of 13 899 events, 3859 patients did not have ROC (median age, 7 months [IQR, 0 months to 7 years]; 2175 boys [56%]). Among event nonsurvivors, median CPR duration was longer in those with initial rhythms of bradycardia with poor perfusion (8.37 [95% CI, 5.70-11.03] minutes; P < .001), pulseless electrical activity (8.22 [95% CI, 5.44-11.00] minutes; P < .001), and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (6.17 [95% CI, 0.09-12.26] minutes; P = .047) (vs asystole). Shorter median CPR duration was associated with neonates compared with older children (-4.86 [95% CI, -8.88 to -0.84] minutes; P = .02), emergency department compared with pediatric intensive car7 e unit location (-4.02 [95% CI, -7.48 to -0.57] minutes; P = .02), and members of racial or ethnic minority groups compared with White patients (-3.67 [95% CI, -6.18 to -1.17]; P = .004). Among all CPR events, the adjusted odds of survival to discharge differed based on hospital quartile of median CPR duration among events without ROC; compared with quartile 1 (15.0-25.9 minutes), the adjusted odds ratio for quartile 2 (26.0-29.4 minutes) was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.09-1.36; P < .001); for quartile 3 (29.5-32.9 minutes), 1.23 (95% CI, 1.08-1.39; P = .002); and for quartile 4 (33.0-53.0 minutes), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.91-1.19; P = .58). In this retrospective cohort study of pediatric in-hospital CPR, several factors, including age and event location, were associated with CPR duration in event nonsurvivors. The odds of survival to discharge were lower for patients at hospitals with the shortest and longest median CPR durations among events without ROC. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal duration of CPR during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest and to provide training guidelines for resuscitation teams to eliminate disparities in resuscitation care.","O'Halloran Amanda, Morgan Ryan W, Kennedy Kevin, Berg Robert A, Gathers Cody-Aaron, Naim Maryam Y, Nadkarni Vinay, Reeder Ron, Topjian Alexis, Wolfe Heather, Kleinman Monica, Chan Paul S, Sutton Robert M",JAMA network open,2024,39078626,PMC11289702,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.24670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39078626,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11289702,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Attentional Bias for Opioids in Taiwanese Heavy Smokers with Chronic Noncancer Pain.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Attentional bias (AB) for addictive substances is a feature of attention found in individuals with substance misuse or diagnosed with substance use disorders. When AB exists, the attention of the addicted individual may be quickly oriented to cues related to the addictive substance or be maintained on these cues for a longer time. AB toward opioids was found in Western samples of smokers with chronic noncancer pain. The level of AB was dose-responsive. However, similar studies in the Taiwanese population are lacking. This study compared the patterns of AB for opioid analgesics in Taiwanese participants with chronic noncancer pain to that of individuals without pain. This study aimed to investigate if AB toward opioids is presented in Taiwanese heavy smokers who are on long-term opioid therapy for pain control. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Participants were grouped into chronic noncancer pain smokers, chronic pain nonsmokers, and smokers without pain, according to smoking habits and whether or not on long-term opioid therapy for pain control. Each participant completed demographic questionnaires, mood scales, and the opioid-related visual probe task. Differences in AB among the groups were compared using a three-way analysis of covariance controlling for daily cigarette consumption. <i>Results:</i> Chronic noncancer pain smokers (<i>n</i> = 17) and chronic pain nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 16) displayed more severe levels of depression, anxiety, and pain, compared to smokers without pain (<i>n</i> = 28). Only did chronic pain nonsmokers show significant AB for opioid cues that were displayed for a short time. Analysis on reaction time found that smokers without pain consistently responded faster to the tasks. No difference in reaction time was found between the pain groups. <i>Conclusions:</i> The current study did not fully replicate findings from studies that were based in Western countries. Formulary availability and regulatory limitations might have affected patient's perception of prescription opioids in Taiwan. However, chronic pain nonsmokers exhibited initial orientation toward opioid-related cues when daily cigarette consumption was accounted for. According to previous research, this AB for shortly displayed opioid cues can be associated with the expectation of pain relief. The current finding also indicated general psychomotor retardation in individuals who were on long-term use of opioids.","Liu Ling-Jun, Lin Edward Meng-Hua, Tsao Shao-Lun, Wang Hsin-Yu, Ho Ming-Chou","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024,39064536,PMC11279384,10.3390/medicina60071107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39064536,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11279384,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Faculty Onboarding for Workforce Readiness and Belonging.,"An academic anesthesiology department benefits from recruiting faculty from various centers, from new graduates to experienced clinicians. Two critical objectives for a department are getting the faculty members up-to-speed thoroughly and efficiently and retaining the faculty members to benefit from their contributions over time. Onboarding plays a pivotal role in meeting both objectives. A successful onboarding process is critical to the enculturation of new employees into an existing work environment. Organizations focusing on improving onboarding practices increase overall success, decrease attrition, and enhance member performance and satisfaction. In this study, we examine our onboarding practices and then create structured tools to improve our processes. A survey gauging the effectiveness and satisfaction of our existing onboarding practices was administered to 11 faculty members hired between 2016 and 2018. Using feedback from the survey, our team identified critical components for improvement and quality measures for onboarding from before faculty arrival until after starting clinical duties. We also measured faculty satisfaction with the onboarding process at different time points. Updated onboarding practices targeting identified areas were implemented in one hiring cycle. Thirteen new faculty members hired over the course of the course of six months assessed the new system's effectiveness. The experience of the previous cohort was compared to the new cohort, highlighting the impact of their feedback on the onboarding process. Our new best practices model, implemented to address primary gaps in our system, has shown promising results. The post-intervention cohort reported more favorable responses to the process, suggesting a positive shift in the onboarding experience. Further free-text feedback included recommendations for additional updates, offering a proactive approach to continuous improvement. A structured, feedback-responsive onboarding process improved the overall experience for new hires. While the response was overwhelmingly positive, further refinement with subsequent iterations is needed to continually improve this process.","Masaracchia Melissa M, Markowitz Scott D, Janosy Norah R, Strupp Kim M",Cureus,2024,39036163,PMC11260497,10.7759/cureus.62856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036163,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11260497,TRUE,"Structured onboarding tools and processes developed based on faculty feedback, including components from before arrival through clinical duties",New faculty members in an academic anesthesiology department,"Improved faculty satisfaction, decreased attrition, enhanced performance, and better workforce readiness and belonging",TRUE,"A structured, feedback-responsive onboarding process from before faculty arrival until after starting clinical duties.

Perioperative Immunosuppressive Factors during Cancer Surgery: An Updated Review.,"Surgical excision of the primary tumor represents the most frequent and curative procedure for solid malignancies. Compelling evidence suggests that, despite its beneficial effects, surgery may impair immunosurveillance by triggering an immunosuppressive inflammatory stress response and favor recurrence by stimulating minimal residual disease. In addition, many factors interfere with the immune effectors before and after cancer procedures, such as malnutrition, anemia, or subsequent transfusion. Thus, the perioperative period plays a key role in determining oncological outcomes and represents a short phase to circumvent anesthetic and surgical deleterious factors by supporting the immune system through the use of synergistic pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. In line with this, accumulating studies indicate that anesthetic agents could drive both protumor or antitumor signaling pathways during or after cancer surgery. While preclinical investigations focusing on anesthetics' impact on the behavior of cancer cells are quite convincing, limited clinical trials studying the consequences on survival and recurrences remain inconclusive. Herein, we highlight the main factors occurring during the perioperative period of cancer surgery and their potential impact on immunomodulation and cancer progression. We also discuss patient management prior to and during surgery, taking into consideration the latest advances in the literature.","Bezu Lucillia, Akçal Öksüz Dilara, Bell Max, Buggy Donal, Diaz-Cambronero Oscar, Enlund Mats, Forget Patrice, Gupta Anil, Hollmann Markus W, Ionescu Daniela, Kirac Iva, Ma Daqing, Mokini Zhirajr, Piegeler Tobias, Pranzitelli Giuseppe, Smith Laura",Cancers,2024,39001366,PMC11240822,10.3390/cancers16132304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39001366,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11240822,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Critical Event Checklists for Simulated In-Hospital Dysrhythmias in Children with Heart Disease.,"Children with heart disease are at increased risk of unstable dysrhythmias and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Clinician adherence to lifesaving processes of care is an important contributor to improving patient outcomes. This study evaluated whether critical event checklists improve adherence to lifesaving processes during simulated acute events secondary to unstable dysrhythmias. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a cardiac ward in a tertiary care, academic children's hospital. Unannounced simulated emergencies involving dysrhythmias in pediatric patients with underlying cardiac disease were conducted weekly. Responders were pediatric and anesthesiology residents, respiratory therapists, and bedside registered nurses. Six teams were randomized into two groups-three received checklists (intervention) and three did not (control). Each team participated in four simulated scenarios over a 4-week pediatric cardiology rotation. Participants received a brief slideshow presentation, which included a checklist orientation, at the start of their rotation. Simulations were video and audio recorded and those with three or more participants were included for analysis. The primary outcome was team adherence to lifesaving processes, expressed as the percentage of completed critical management steps. Secondary outcomes included participant perceptions of the checklist usefulness in identifying and managing dysrhythmias. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, which accounted for clustering within groups, to evaluate the effects of the intervention. A total of 24 simulations were conducted; one of the 24 simulations was excluded due to an insufficient number of participants. In our GEE analysis, 81.21% (78.96%, 83.47%) of critical steps were completed with checklists available versus 68.06% (59.38%, 76.74%) without checklists (p = 0.004). Ninety-three percent of study participants reported that they would use the checklists during an unstable dysrhythmia of a child with underlying cardiac disease. Checklists were associated with improved adherence to lifesaving processes during simulated resuscitations for unstable pediatric dysrhythmias. These findings support the use of scenario specific checklists for the management of unstable dysrhythmias in simulations involving pediatric patients with underlying cardiac disease. Future studies should investigate whether checklists are as effective in actual pediatric in-hospital emergencies.","Spencer Robert, Sen Anita I, Kessler David O, Salabay Kristina, Compagnone Tammy, Zhang Yun, Choudhury Tarif A",Pediatric cardiology,2024,38965102,,10.1007/s00246-024-03564-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38965102,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Participants received a brief slideshow presentation, which included a checklist orientation, at the start of their rotation.","Pediatric and anesthesiology residents, respiratory therapists, and bedside registered nurses.",Improved adherence to lifesaving processes during simulated resuscitations for unstable pediatric dysrhythmias.
Comparison of human cadaver and blue phantom for teaching ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia to novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology: A randomized controlled trial.,"Simulation is increasingly used in medical teaching. Various studies have evaluated different simulation models for training of regional anesthesia (RA). We compared the use of human cadaver and blue phantom models for training of regional anesthesia to novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology. Fifty students were taught knobology of the ultrasonography (USG) machine. They were divided into two equal groups by computer-generated random number table, and the groups assigned were kept in sealed envelopes. In group BP, students were trained on a blue phantom model, and in group HC, students were trained on human cadaver. After training, a didactic video of sonoanatomy of the supraclavicular block was shown to all participants. The block performance was then judged on patients requiring supraclavicular block. The primary objective of the study was to compare the block performance time, and secondary objectives were the quality of image acquired, orientation of transducer to the target, identification of ultrasound artifacts, errors committed, complications, and success rate. The mean block performance time was shorter in group HC compared to group BP (451.96 ± 50.25 and 526.48 ± 43.486 s, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.001). The image quality score, transducer orientation to the target, and identification of USG artifacts were better in group HC compared to group BP, with lesser number of needle passes. Cadaver-based training produced better results compared to blue phantom simulator model for teaching of ultrasound-guided RA to novice postgraduate trainees of anesthesiology.","Dang Deepanshu, Kamal Manoj, Kumar Mritunjay, Paliwal Bharat, Nayyar Ashish, Bhatia Pradeep, Singariya Geeta","Journal of anaesthesiology, clinical pharmacology",2024,38919433,PMC11196044,10.4103/joacp.joacp_234_22,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38919433,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11196044,TRUE,Comparison of human cadaver versus blue phantom simulation models for teaching ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology,"Improved block performance time, better image quality, better transducer orientation, better identification of ultrasound artifacts, and fewer needle passes",TRUE,Simulation training using human cadaver and blue phantom models for teaching ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology,"Improved block performance time, better quality of image acquired, improved orientation of transducer to the target, better identification of ultrasound artifacts, fewer errors and complications, and higher success rate"
Myocardial SERCA2 Protects Against Cardiac Damage and Dysfunction Caused by Inhaled Bromine.,"Myocardial sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) activity is critical for heart function. We have demonstrated that inhaled halogen (chlorine or bromine) gases inactivate SERCA2, impair calcium homeostasis, increase proteolysis, and damage the myocardium ultimately leading to cardiac dysfunction. To further elucidate the mechanistic role of SERCA2 in halogen-induced myocardial damage, we used bromine-exposed cardiac-specific SERCA2 knockout (KO) mice [tamoxifen-administered SERCA2 (<i>flox/flox)</i> Tg (<i>α</i>MHC-MerCreMer) mice] and compared them to the oil-administered controls. We performed echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis to investigate cardiac function 24 hours after bromine (600 ppm for 30 minutes) exposure and measured cardiac injury markers in plasma and proteolytic activity in cardiac tissue and performed electron microscopy of the left ventricle (LV). Cardiac-specific SERCA2 knockout mice demonstrated enhanced toxicity to bromine. Bromine exposure increased ultrastructural damage, perturbed LV shape geometry, and demonstrated acutely increased phosphorylation of phospholamban in the KO mice. Bromine-exposed KO mice revealed significantly enhanced mean arterial pressure and sphericity index and decreased LV end diastolic diameter and LV end systolic pressure when compared with the bromine-exposed control FF mice. Strain analysis showed loss of synchronicity, evidenced by an irregular endocardial shape in systole and irregular vector orientation of contractile motion across different segments of the LV in KO mice, both at baseline and after bromine exposure. These studies underscore the critical role of myocardial SERCA2 in preserving cardiac ultrastructure and function during toxic halogen gas exposures. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Due to their increased industrial production and transportation, halogens such as chlorine and bromine pose an enhanced risk of exposure to the public. Our studies have demonstrated that inhalation of these halogens leads to the inactivation of cardiopulmonary SERCA2 and results in calcium overload. Using cardiac-specific SERCA2 KO mice, these studies further validated the role of SERCA2 in bromine-induced myocardial injury. These studies highlight the increased susceptibility of individuals with pathological loss of cardiac SERCA2 to the effects of bromine.","Masjoan Juncos Juan Xavier, Nadeem Fahad, Shakil Shazia, El-Husari Malik, Zafar Iram, Louch William E, Halade Ganesh V, Zaky Ahmed, Ahmad Aftab, Ahmad Shama",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2024,38772719,PMC11192580,10.1124/jpet.123.002084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38772719,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11192580,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Lessons Learned-A Case for Required Student Services 1:1 Orientation.,"Both faculty and student learners associated with physician assistant/associate (PA) programs continue to suffer from the effects of the ongoing mental health crisis. Furthermore, student learners may have other personal needs impacting their potential success in PA school (ie, financial, academic, or other). A proactive approach to supporting student learners early in their PA educational journey is warranted. Required 1:1 face-to-face orientations between incoming PA students and a representative from the Office of Wellness and Academic Support (OWAS) were implemented during the first week of PA program orientation. Students were allowed time and space to privately share their individual experiences and concerns as they entered PA school. In addition, the student services representative from OWAS was able to provide customized education on the variety of resources available for students. The student services representative from OWAS established personal relationships with each of the incoming PA students. Multiple follow-up appointments and referrals were made to various service lines including tutoring, learner accommodations, and mental health counseling. The implementation of required 1:1 face-to-face orientations between incoming PA students and student services during the first week of PA program orientation was highly effective. The primary lesson learned is that a simple, preventative, proactive approach can be extremely impactful if we are willing to view the challenges of student learners in PA education through a different lens.","Hoffmann Chelsey, Griffey Stacy",The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,2024,38753967,,10.1097/JPA.0000000000000601,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38753967,,TRUE,Required 1:1 face-to-face orientations between incoming PA students and a representative from the Office of Wellness and Academic Support (OWAS) during the first week of PA program orientation,Incoming physician assistant/associate (PA) students,"Early identification of student needs, establishment of personal relationships, facilitation of appropriate referrals to support services, and proactive support for student success",FALSE,,,
German guidelines for airway management 2023.,"The German airway management guidelines are intended to serve as an orientation and decision-making aid and thus contribute to the optimal care of patients undergoing anesthesiologic- and intensive medical care. As part of the pre-anesthesiologic evaluation, anatomical and physiological indications for difficult mask ventilation and intubation shall be evaluated. This includes the assessment of mouth opening, dental status, mandibular protrusion, cervical spine mobility and existing pathologies. The airway shall be secured while maintaining spontaneous breathing if there are predictors or anamnestic indications of difficult or impossible mask ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. Various techniques can be used here. If there is an unexpectedly difficult airway, a video laryngoscope is recommended after unsuccessful direct laryngoscopy, consequently a video laryngoscope must be available at every anesthesiology workplace. The airway shall primarily be secured with a video laryngoscope in critically ill- and patients at risk of aspiration. Securing the airway using translaryngeal and transtracheal techniques is the ""ultima ratio"" in airway management. The performance or supervision of airway management in the intensive care unit is the responsibility of experienced physicians and nursing staff. Appropriate education and regular training are essential. Clear communication and interaction between team members are mandatory before every airway management procedure. Once the airway has been secured, the correct position of the endotracheal tube must be verified using capnography.","Piepho Tim, Kriege M, Byhahn C, Cavus E, Dörges V, Ilper H, Kehl F, Loop T, Raymondos K, Sujatta S, Timmermann A, Zwißler B, Noppens R",Die Anaesthesiologie,2024,38753159,,10.1007/s00101-024-01413-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38753159,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Ultrasound-Responsive Aligned Piezoelectric Nanofibers Derived Hydrogel Conduits for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.,"Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are considered as promising treatment strategy and frontier trend for peripheral nerve regeneration, while their therapeutic outcomes are limited by the lack of controllable drug delivery and available physicochemical cues. Herein, novel aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs with ultrasound (US)-triggered electrical stimulation (ES) and controllable drug release for repairing peripheral nerve injury are proposed. The inner layer of the NGCs is the barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles (BTNPs)-doped polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene [BTNPs/P(VDF-TrFE)] electrospinning nanofibers with improved piezoelectricity and aligned orientation. The outer side of the NGCs is the thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel with bioactive drug encapsulation. Such NGCs can not only induce neuronal-oriented extension and promote neurite outgrowth with US-triggered wireless ES, but also realize the controllable nerve growth factor release with the hydrogel shrinkage under US-triggered heating. Thus, the NGC can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve axonal regeneration of rat models with long sciatic nerve defects. It is believed that the proposed US-responsive aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs will find important applications in clinic neural tissue engineering.","Xu Dongyu, Fu Siqi, Zhang Hui, Lu Weicheng, Xie Jingdun, Li Jilai, Wang Huan, Zhao Yuanjin, Chai Renjie","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2024,38744452,,10.1002/adma.202307896,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38744452,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Probing white matter microstructure in youth with chronic pain and its relation to catastrophizing using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging.,"Chronic pain is common in young people and can have a major life impact. Despite the burden of chronic pain, mechanisms underlying chronic pain development and persistence are still poorly understood. Specifically, white matter (WM) connectivity has remained largely unexplored in pediatric chronic pain. Using diffusion-weighted imaging, this study examined WM microstructure in adolescents (age M = 15.8 years, SD = 2.8 years) with chronic pain (n = 44) compared with healthy controls (n = 24). Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging modeling was applied, and voxel-based whole-white-matter analyses were used to obtain an overview of potential alterations in youth with chronic pain and tract-specific profile analyses to evaluate microstructural profiles of tracts of interest more closely. Our main findings are that (1) youth with chronic pain showed widespread elevated orientation dispersion compared with controls in several tracts, indicative of less coherence; (2) signs of neurite density tract-profile alterations were observed in several tracts of interest, with mainly higher density levels in patients; and (3) several WM microstructural alterations were associated with pain catastrophizing in the patient group. Implicated tracts include both those connecting cortical and limbic structures (uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, anterior thalamic radiation), which were associated with pain catastrophizing, as well as sensorimotor tracts (corticospinal tract). By identifying alterations in the biologically informative WM microstructural metrics orientation dispersion and neurite density, our findings provide important and novel mechanistic insights for understanding the pathophysiology underlying chronic pain. Taken together, the data support alterations in fiber organization as a meaningful characteristic, contributing process to the chronic pain state.","Timmers Inge, Biggs Emma E, Bruckert Lisa, Tremblay-McGaw Alexandra G, Zhang Hui, Borsook David, Simons Laura E",Pain,2024,38718105,PMC11511653,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38718105,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11511653,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Blind source separation of event-related potentials using a recurrent neural network.,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a superposition of electric potential differences generated by neurophysiological activity associated with psychophysical events. Spatiotemporal dissociation of these signal sources can supplement conventional ERP analysis and improve source localization. However, results from established source separation methods applied to ERPs can be challenging to interpret. Hence, we have developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) method for blind source separation. The RNN transforms input step pulse signals representing events into corresponding ERP difference waveforms. Source waveforms are obtained from penultimate layer units and scalp maps are obtained from feed-forward output layer weights that project these source waveforms onto EEG electrode amplitudes. An interpretable, sparse source representation is achieved by incorporating L1 regularization of signals obtained from the penultimate layer of the network during training. This RNN method was applied to four ERP difference waveforms (MMN, N170, N400, P3) from the open-access ERP CORE database, and independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to the same data for comparison. The RNN decomposed these ERPs into eleven spatially and temporally separate sources that were less noisy, tended to be more ERP-specific, and were less similar to each other than ICA-derived sources. The RNN sources also had less ambiguity between source waveform amplitude, scalp potential polarity, and equivalent current dipole orientation than ICA sources. In conclusion, the proposed RNN blind source separation method can be effectively applied to grand-average ERP difference waves and holds promise for further development as a computational model of event-related neural signals.","O'Reilly Jamie A, Sunthornwiriya-Amon Hassapong, Aparprasith Naradith, Kittichalao Pannapa, Chairojwong Pornnaphas, Klai-On Thanabodee, Lannon Edward W",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2024,38712076,PMC11071372,10.1101/2024.04.23.590794,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38712076,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11071372,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

The aim of this study is to observe the effects of intraoperative low-dose esketamine on postoperative pain after vestibular schwannoma resection. This single-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial included 90 adults undergoing VS resection via the retrosigmoid approach with TIVA. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: esketamine or control (n = 45 in each group). Patients received low-dose esketamine (0.2 mg/kg) or a similar volume of normal saline after dural closure. The primary outcome was the pain score during movement (gentle head movement) at 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included recovery time, bispectral index (BIS) values and haemodynamic profiles during the first 30 min after esketamine administration, and adverse effects. Low-dose esketamine did not reduce pain scores at rest (P > .05) or with movement (P > .05) within the first 24 h after surgery.

The chain of survival and rehabilitation for sepsis: concepts and proposals for healthcare trajectory optimization.,"This article describes the structures and processes involved in healthcare delivery for sepsis, from the prehospital setting until rehabilitation. Quality improvement initiatives in sepsis may reduce both morbidity and mortality. Positive outcomes are more likely when the following steps are optimized: early recognition, severity assessment, prehospital emergency medical system activation when available, early therapy (antimicrobials and hemodynamic optimization), early orientation to an adequate facility (emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit), in-hospital organ failure resuscitation associated with source control, and finally a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Such a trajectory of care dedicated to sepsis amounts to a chain of survival and rehabilitation for sepsis. Implementation of this chain of survival and rehabilitation for sepsis requires full interconnection between each link. To date, despite regular international recommendations updates, the adherence to sepsis guidelines remains low leading to a considerable burden of the disease.

Single-center experience with Knee+™ augmented reality navigation system in primary total knee arthroplasty.,"Computer-assisted systems obtained an increased interest in orthopaedic surgery over the last years, as they enhance precision compared to conventional hardware. The expansion of computer assistance is evolving with the employment of augmented reality. Yet, the accuracy of augmented reality navigation systems has not been determined. To examine the accuracy of component alignment and restoration of the affected limb's mechanical axis in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), utilizing an augmented reality navigation system and to assess whether such systems are conspicuously fruitful for an accomplished knee surgeon. From May 2021 to December 2021, 30 patients, 25 women and five men, underwent a primary unilateral TKA. Revision cases were excluded. A preoperative radiographic procedure was performed to evaluate the limb's axial alignment. All patients were operated on by the same team, without a tourniquet, utilizing three distinct prostheses with the assistance of the Knee+™ augmented reality navigation system in every operation. Postoperatively, the same radiographic exam protocol was executed to evaluate the implants' position, orientation and coronal plane alignment. We recorded measurements in 3 stages regarding femoral varus and flexion, tibial varus and posterior slope. Firstly, the expected values from the Augmented Reality system were documented. Then we calculated the same values after each cut and finally, the same measurements were recorded radiologically after the operations. Concerning statistical analysis, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was estimated, while Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was performed when needed. A statistically significant difference was observed regarding mean expected values and radiographic measurements for femoral flexion measurements only (<i>Z</i> score = 2.67, <i>P</i> value = 0.01). Nonetheless, this difference was statistically significantly lower than 1 degree (<i>Z</i> score = -4.21, <i>P</i> value < 0.01). In terms of discrepancies in the calculations of expected values and controlled measurements, a statistically significant difference between tibial varus values was detected (<i>Z</i> score = -2.33, <i>P</i> value = 0.02), which was also statistically significantly lower than 1 degree (<i>Z</i> score = -4.99, <i>P</i> value < 0.01). The results indicate satisfactory postoperative coronal alignment without outliers across all three different implants utilized.

How Did Black and Hispanic Orthopaedic Applicants and Residents Compare to General Surgery Between 2015 and 2022?,"Despite the heavy demand for and knowledge of the benefits of diversity, there is a persistent lack of racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in orthopaedic surgery. Since the implementation of diversity initiatives, data have shown that general surgery has been one of the top competitive surgical fields and has demonstrated growth in racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, making general surgery a good point of reference and comparison when analyzing racial and ethnic growth in orthopaedic surgery. (1) What were the growth rates for Black and Hispanic orthopaedic residency applicants and residents between 2015 and 2022? (2) How did the growth rates of Black and Hispanic individuals in orthopaedic surgery compare with those of general surgery? (3) How did applicant recruitment and resident acceptance differ between Black and Hispanic people in orthopaedic surgery? Applicant data were obtained from historical specialty-specific data from the Association of American Medical Colleges Electronic Residency Application Service Statistics database between 2018 and 2022, and resident data were obtained from the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Book between 2015 and 2021. Between 2018 and 2022, the number of residency applicants totaled 216,677, with 17,912 Black residency applicants and 20,413 Hispanic residency applicants. Between 2015 and 2021, the number of active residents totaled 977,877, with 48,600 Black residents and 62,605 Hispanic residents. Because the applicant and resident data do not overlap throughout all years of observation, a sensitivity analysis of overlapping years (between 2018 and 2021) was conducted to ensure observed trends were consistent and valid throughout the study. All datasets obtained were used to establish the different racial and ethnic proportions of Black and Hispanic residency applicants and residents in four nonsurgical primary care specialties and four surgical subspecialties. A reference slope was created using data from the Association of American Medical Colleges and Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education to represent the growth rate for total residency applicants and residents, independently, across all residency specialties reported in each database. This slope was used for comparison among the resident and applicant growth rates for all eight selected specialties. Datapoints were placed into a scatterplot with regression lines, using slope equations to depict rate of growth and R 2 values to depict linear fit. Applicant growth corresponded to applicant recruitment and resident growth corresponded to resident acceptance. Chi-square tests were used to compare residents and residency applicants for the Black and Hispanic populations, separately. Two-way analysis of variance with a time-by-specialty interaction term (F-test) was conducted to determine differences between growth slopes. There was no difference in the growth rate of Black orthopaedic surgery applicants between 2018 and 2022, and there was no difference in the growth rate of Hispanic orthopaedic surgery applicants (R 2 = 0.43; p = 0.23 and R 2 = 0.63; p = 0.11, respectively). However, there was a very slight increase in the growth rate of Black orthopaedic surgery residents between 2015 and 2021, and a very slight increase in the growth rate of Hispanic orthopaedic surgery residents (R 2 = 0.73; p = 0.02 and R 2 = 0.79; p = 0.01, respectively). There were no differences in orthopaedic and general surgery rates of growth for Black applicants between 2018 and 2022 (0.004 applicants/year versus -0.001 applicants/year; p = 0.22), and no differences were found in orthopaedic and general surgery rates of growth for Black residents between 2015 and 2021 (0.003 residents/year versus 0.002 residents/year; p = 0.59). Likewise, Hispanic orthopaedic applicant growth rates did not differ between 2018 and 2022 from the rates of general surgery (0.004 applicants/year versus 0.005 applicants/year; p = 0.68), and there were no differences in orthopaedic and general surgery rates of growth for Hispanic residents (0.007 residents/year versus 0.01 residents/year; p = 0.35). Furthermore, growth rate comparisons between Black orthopaedic applicants and residents between 2018 and 2021 showed applicant growth was larger than resident growth, illustrating that the recruitment of Black applicants increased slightly more rapidly than resident acceptance. Growth rate comparisons between Hispanic applicants and residents showed a larger rate of resident growth, illustrating Hispanic resident acceptance increased slightly faster than applicant recruitment during that time. We found low acceptance of Black residents compared with the higher recruitment of Black applicants, as well as overall low proportions of Black and Hispanic applicants and residents. Future studies might explore the factors contributing to the higher acceptances of Hispanic orthopaedic residents than Black orthopaedic residents. We recommend that more emphasis should be placed on increasing Black and Hispanic representation at the department level to ensure cultural considerations remain at the forefront of applicant recruitment. Internal or external reviews of residency selection processes should be considered, and more immersive, longitudinal orthopaedic surgery clerkships and research mentorship experiences should be targeted toward Black and Hispanic students. Holistic reviews of applications and selection processes should be implemented to produce an increased racially and ethnically diverse applicant pool and a diverse residency work force, and implicit bias training should be implemented to address potential biases and diversity barriers that are present in residency programs and leadership.","Williams Alisha J, Malewicz Julia I, Pum John M, Zurakowski David, Day Charles S",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,2024,38578021,PMC11272338,10.1097/CORR.0000000000003069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38578021,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11272338,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The New Orientation of Postoperative Analgesia: Remote Ischemic Preconditioning.,"Postoperative analgesia is currently a significant topic in anesthesiology. Currently, the predominant approach for achieving multimodal analgesia involves the utilization of pharmacotherapy and regional anesthesia procedures. The primary objectives of this approach are to mitigate postoperative pain, enhance patient satisfaction, and diminish overall opioid usage. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research on the use of remote ischemia preconditioning aimed at mitigating postoperative pain. Transient stoppage of blood flow to an organ has been found to elicit remote ischemia preconditioning (RIPC), which serves as a potent intrinsic mechanism for protecting numerous organs. In addition to its established role in protecting against reperfusion injury, RIPC has recently been identified as having potential benefits in the context of postoperative analgesia. In addition to traditional perioperative analgesia, RIPC provides perioperative analgesia and organ protection.","Xiao Yunyu, Zhang Shaofeng, Ren Qiusheng",Journal of pain research,2024,38524690,PMC10959302,10.2147/JPR.S455127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38524690,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10959302,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Top 5 barriers in cardiac arrest research as perceived by international early career researchers - A consensus study.,"Cardiac arrest research has not received as much scientific attention as research on other topics. Here, we aimed to identify cardiac arrest research barriers from the perspective of an international group of early career researchers. Attendees of the 2022 international masterclass on cardiac arrest registry research accompanied the Global Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Registry collaborative meeting in Utstein, Norway, and used an adapted hybrid nominal group technique to obtain a diverse and comprehensive perspective. Barriers were identified using a web-based questionnaire and discussed and ranked during an in-person follow-up meeting. After each response was discussed and clarified, barriers were categorized and ranked over two rounds. Each participant scored these from 1 (least significant) to 5 (most significant). Nine participants generated 36 responses, forming seven overall categories of cardiac arrest research barriers. ""Allocated research time"" was ranked first in both rounds. ""Scientific environment"", including appropriate mentorship and support systems, ranked second in the final ranking. ""Resources"", including funding and infrastructure, ranked third. ""Access to and availability of cardiac arrest research data"" was the fourth-ranked barrier. This included data from the cardiac arrest registries, medical devices, and clinical studies. Finally, ""uniqueness"" was the fifth-ranked barrier. This included ethical issues, patient recruitment challenges, and unique characteristics of cardiac arrest. By identifying cardiac arrest research barriers and suggesting solutions, this study may act as a tool for stakeholders to focus on helping early career researchers overcome these barriers, thus paving the road for future research.","Katzenschlager Stephan, Elshaer Ahmed, Metelmann Bibiana, Metelmann Camilla, Thilakasiri Kaushila, Karageorgos Vlasios, Barry Tomas, Alm-Kruse Kristin, Karim Hritul, Maurer Holger, Kramer-Johansen Jo, Orlob Simon",Resuscitation plus,2024,38524147,PMC10957401,10.1016/j.resplu.2024.100608,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38524147,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10957401,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Development and Implementation of the Fast-Pace Assessment Framework and Tiered Analgesic Orders for Opioid Optimization.,"Within the context of the opioid epidemic, changes needed to be made in the prescription and administration of analgesics. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of a project that utilized a holistic pain assessment framework and introduced new order sets to guide the integration of nonopioid, opioid, and co-analgesics in a quaternary care medical center. An interdisciplinary team updated policies and procedures for pain assessment and opioid administration and created new analgesic order sets for both adult and pediatric patients. Following requisite approvals, these order sets were integrated into the electronic health record. Education of clinicians, patients, and caregivers was provided to facilitate implementation of these new clinical practices. Prescribers' levels of adherence with the use of the pain order sets ranged from 80% to 90% and no adverse effects were reported. Education of nursing staff was incorporated into hospital orientation. Ongoing evaluations are providing insights into how the new policies and procedures can be optimized to ensure reliable, safe, and effective pain management. Since the implementation of the opioid optimization project, adherence with the tiered, multimodal approach to analgesic prescribing is high. Next steps include both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the benefits and challenges associated with this practice change. For example, systems will be developed to monitor nurses' adherence with the implementation of the pain order sets and the use of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management interventions.","Bazinski Marilyn, Lau Catherine, Clemons Brooke, Purser Lisa, Kangwankij Amy, Ngo Lena, Lang Michael, Besen Brianna, Gross Kendall, Borucki Amber, Behrends Matthias, Miaskowski Christine, Schell-Chaple Hildy",Pain management nursing : official journal of the American Society of Pain Management Nurses,2024,38522974,,10.1016/j.pmn.2024.01.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38522974,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Education of clinicians, patients, and caregivers was provided to facilitate implementation of these new clinical practices.

Team principles for successful interdisciplinary research teams.,"Interdisciplinary research teams can be extremely beneficial when addressing difficult clinical problems. The incorporation of conceptual and methodological strategies from a variety of research disciplines and health professions yields transformative results. In this setting, the long-term goal of team science is to improve patient care, with emphasis on population health outcomes. However, team principles necessary for effective research teams are rarely taught in health professional schools. To form successful interdisciplinary research teams in cardio-oncology and beyond, guiding principles and organizational recommendations are necessary. Cardiovascular disease results in annual direct costs of $220 billion (about $680 per person in the US) and is the leading cause of death for cancer survivors, including adult survivors of childhood cancers. Optimizing cardio-oncology research in interdisciplinary research teams has the potential to aid in the investigation of strategies for saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year in the United States and mitigating the annual cost of cardiovascular disease. Despite published reports on experiences developing research teams across organizations, specialties and settings, there is no single journal article that compiles principles for cardiology or cardio-oncology research teams. In this review, recurring threads linked to working as a team, as well as optimal methods, advantages, and problems that arise when managing teams are described in the context of career development and research. The worth and hurdles of a team approach, based on practical lessons learned from establishing our multidisciplinary research team and information gleaned from relevant specialties in the development of a successful team are presented.","Brown Sherry-Ann, Sparapani Rodney, Osinski Kristen, Zhang Jun, Blessing Jeffrey, Cheng Feixiong, Hamid Abdulaziz, MohamadiPour Mehri Bagheri, Lal Jessica Castrillon, Kothari Anai N, Caraballo Pedro, Noseworthy Peter, Johnson Roger H, Hansen Kathryn, Sun Louise Y, Crotty Bradley, Cheng Yee Chung, Echefu Gift, Doshi Krishna, Olson Jessica",American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,2023,38510201,PMC10946054,10.1016/j.ahjo.2023.100306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38510201,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10946054,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity Discrimination and Chronic Pain in Children: A National Study.,"This study provides national estimates of parental perceived child sexual orientation or gender minority (SGM) discrimination and examines associations between SGM discrimination and chronic pain in children. Cross-sectional analysis of the 2020 and 2021 National Survey of Children's Health (N=47,213). Caregivers of children ages 6-17 years old reported whether their child had ever been treated or judged unfairly (i.e., discrimination) because of their SGM identity. Chronic pain in children was defined as frequent or chronic difficulty with repeated or chronic physical pain during the past 12 months, as reported by caregivers. Weighted prevalence estimates for discrimination were calculated for the whole sample and sociodemographic subgroups. Associations between SGM discrimination and chronic pain were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression models adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Analyses were conducted 2022-2023. Within this nationally representative sample, parents reported 1.4% (95% CI 1.2%-1.6%) of children have experienced SGM-related discrimination. The prevalence was higher among adolescents, females at birth, and those living in suburban areas. Children who experienced discrimination had a higher prevalence of chronic pain (20.2%) compared to those who did not (7.0%, p<0.0001), with an adjusted prevalence rate ratio of 2.0 (95% CI 1.5-2.5, p<0.0001). Based on parent report, about 0.6 million children in the U.S. have experienced SGM-based discrimination; these children are twice as likely to have chronic pain. Findings highlight the importance of assessment and intervention for chronic pain in children who may experience marginalization and discrimination due to their sexual orientation and gender identity.","Weiss Karen E, Li Rui, Chen Diane, Palermo Tonya M, Scheurich Jennifer A, Groenewald Cornelius B",American journal of preventive medicine,2024,38508423,,10.1016/j.amepre.2024.03.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38508423,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Computational modeling of dorsal root ganglion stimulation using an Injectrode.,"<i>Objective.</i>Minimally invasive neuromodulation therapies like the Injectrode, which is composed of a tightly wound polymer-coated Platinum/Iridium microcoil, offer a low-risk approach for administering electrical stimulation to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). This flexible electrode is aimed to conform to the DRG. The stimulation occurs through a transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) patch, which subsequently transmits the stimulation to the Injectrode via a subcutaneous metal collector. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of stimulation through TES relies on the specific geometrical configurations of the Injectrode-collector-patch system. Hence, there is a need to investigate which design parameters influence the activation of targeted neural structures.<i>Approach.</i>We employed a hybrid computational modeling approach to analyze the impact of Injectrode system design parameters on charge delivery and neural response to stimulation. We constructed multiple finite element method models of DRG stimulation, followed by the implementation of multi-compartment models of DRG neurons. By calculating potential distribution during monopolar stimulation, we simulated neural responses using various parameters based on prior acute experiments. Additionally, we developed a canonical monopolar stimulation and full-scale model of bipolar bilateral L5 DRG stimulation, allowing us to investigate how design parameters like Injectrode size and orientation influenced neural activation thresholds.<i>Main results.</i>Our findings were in accordance with acute experimental measurements and indicate that the minimally invasive Injectrode system predominantly engages large-diameter afferents (A<i>β</i>-fibers). These activation thresholds were contingent upon the surface area of the Injectrode. As the charge density decreased due to increasing surface area, there was a corresponding expansion in the stimulation amplitude range before triggering any pain-related mechanoreceptor (A<i>δ</i>-fibers) activity.<i>Significance.</i>The Injectrode demonstrates potential as a viable technology for minimally invasive stimulation of the DRG. Our findings indicate that utilizing a larger surface area Injectrode enhances the therapeutic margin, effectively distinguishing the desired A<i>β</i>activation from the undesired A<i>δ</i>-fiber activation.","Bhowmick Sauradeep, Graham Robert D, Verma Nishant, Trevathan James K, Franke Manfred, Nieuwoudt Stephan, Fisher Lee E, Shoffstall Andrew J, Weber Douglas J, Ludwig Kip A, Lempka Scott F",Journal of neural engineering,2024,38502956,PMC11007586,10.1088/1741-2552/ad357f,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502956,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11007586,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Withdrawal catastrophizing scale: initial psychometric properties and implications for the study of opioid use disorder and hyperkatifeia.,"<i>Background:</i> Discovery of modifiable factors influencing subjective withdrawal experience might advance opioid use disorder (OUD) research and precision treatment. This study explores one factor - withdrawal catastrophizing - a negative cognitive and emotional orientation toward withdrawal characterized by excessive fear, worry or inability to divert attention from withdrawal symptoms.<i>Objectives:</i> We define a novel concept - withdrawal catastrophizing - and present an initial evaluation of the Withdrawal Catastrophizing Scale (WCS).<i>Methods:</i> Prospective observational study (<i>n</i> = 122, 48.7% women). Factor structure (exploratory factor analysis) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α) were assessed. Predictive validity was tested via correlation between WCS and next-day subjective opiate withdrawal scale (SOWS) severity. The clinical salience of WCS was evaluated by correlation between WCS and withdrawal-motivated behaviors including risk taking, OUD maintenance, OUD treatment delay, history of leaving the hospital against medical advice and buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal.<i>Results:</i> WCS was found to have a two-factor structure (distortion and despair), strong internal consistency (α = .901), and predictive validity - Greater withdrawal catastrophizing was associated with next-day SOWS (r<sub>s</sub> (99) = 0.237, <i>p</i> = .017). Withdrawal catastrophizing was also correlated with risk-taking behavior to relieve withdrawal (r<sub>s</sub> (119) = 0.357, <i>p</i> < .001); withdrawal-motivated OUD treatment avoidance (r<sub>s</sub> (119) = 0.421, <i>p</i> < .001), history of leaving the hospital against medical advice (r<sub>s</sub> (119) = 0.373, <i>p</i> < .001) and buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal (r<sub>s</sub> (119) = 0.369, <i>p</i> < .001).<i>Conclusion:</i> This study provides first evidence of <i>withdrawal catastrophizing</i> as a clinically important phenomenon with implications for the future study and treatment of OUD.","Hall Orman Trent, Vilensky Michael, Teater Julie E, Bryan Craig, Rood Kara, Niedermier Julie, Entrup Parker, Gorka Stephanie, King Anthony, Williams David A, Phan K Luan",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,2025,38502911,,10.1080/00952990.2023.2298257,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502911,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Evaluation of a Course to Teach Medical Students Latent Hazard Identification in the Operating Room.,"To improve situational awareness in the operating room (OR), a virtual online operating room of hazards (ROH) with deliberately placed risks was created. We hypothesized that subjects first participating in the virtual online ROH would identify more hazards during an in-person ROH exercise in a physical OR than those in the control group who only received didactic training. We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a major academic medical center, enrolling 48 pre-clinical medical students with no previous OR exposure during their classes. Control and experimental group subjects participated in a brief, online didactic orientation session conducted live over Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, CA) to learn about latent hazards in the OR. Experimental group subjects further interacted with a virtual online operating ROH in which latent hazards were present. The fraction of deliberately created latent hazards placed in a physical, in-person OR identified by subjects was calculated. Experimental group subjects identified a significantly larger fraction of the created hazards (41.3%) than the control group (difference = 16.4%, 95% CI: 11.3% to 21.4%, P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the number of non-hazards misidentified as hazards between the groups. Participation in the virtual online environment resulted in greater recognition of latent operating room hazards during a simulation conducted in a physical, in-person OR than in a didactic experience alone. Because creating an in-room experience to teach the identification of latent hazards in an OR is resource-intensive and requires removing the OR from clinical use, we recommend the virtual online approach described for training purposes. Adding items most misidentified as hazards is suggested for future implementation.","Cammer Natasha C, Mascarenhas Kristen M, Delgado-Landino Marianfeli C, Horn Danielle B, Araya Roxanna J, Epstein Richard H, Corvington Jean R, Marudo Catherine P, Stein Alecia L, Maga Joni M",Cureus,2024,38501026,PMC10948080,10.7759/cureus.56367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38501026,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10948080,FALSE,,,,TRUE,A virtual online operating room of hazards (ROH) with deliberately placed risks was created.

Patterns of Medical Residents' Preferences for Organizational Socialization Strategies to Facilitate Their Transitions: A Q-study.,"To facilitate various transitions of medical residents, healthcare team members and departments may employ various organizational socialization strategies, including formal and informal onboarding methods. However, residents' preferences for these organizational socialization strategies to ease their transition can vary. This study identifies patterns (viewpoints) in these preferences. Using Q-methodology, we asked a purposeful sample of early-career residents to rank a set of statements into a quasi-normal distributed grid. Statements were based on previous qualitative interviews and organizational socialization theory. Participants responded to the question, 'What are your preferences regarding strategies other health care professionals, departments, or hospitals should use to optimize your next transition?' Participants then explained their sorting choices in a post-sort questionnaire. We identified different viewpoints based on by-person (inverted) factor analysis and Varimax rotation. We interpreted the viewpoints using distinguishing and consensus statements, enriched by residents' comments. Fifty-one residents ranked 42 statements, among whom 36 residents displayed four distinct viewpoints: Dependent residents (n = 10) favored a task-oriented approach, clear guidance, and formal colleague relationships; Social Capitalizing residents (n = 9) preferred structure in the onboarding period and informal workplace social interactions; Autonomous residents (n = 12) prioritized a loosely structured onboarding period, independence, responsibility, and informal social interactions; and Development-oriented residents (n = 5) desired a balanced onboarding period that allowed independence, exploration, and development. This identification of four viewpoints highlights the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all approaches to resident transition. Healthcare professionals and departments should tailor their socialization strategies to residents' preferences for support, structure, and formal/informal social interaction.","Galema Gerbrich, Schönrock-Adema Johanna, Jaarsma Debbie A D C, Wietasch Götz J K G",Perspectives on medical education,2024,38496363,PMC10941690,10.5334/pme.1189,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38496363,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10941690,TRUE,"Tailored socialization strategies based on four identified resident viewpoints (Dependent, Social Capitalizing, Autonomous, and Development-oriented)",Medical residents (not specifically anesthesiology or pain care),"Improved resident transitions through personalized onboarding approaches that match individual preferences for support, structure, and social interaction",TRUE,Various organizational socialization strategies including formal and informal onboarding methods,Early-career medical residents,"Identification of four distinct viewpoints (Dependent, Social Capitalizing, Autonomous, Development-oriented) to tailor socialization strategies according to residents' preferences for support, structure, and formal/informal social interaction"
The effects of hierarchical relationship on well-being of surgical team members in operating theaters: Prospective cohort study.,"Although there are many studies about wellbeing on healthcare professionals, the relationship between hierarchy and well-being has not been studied much. In this study, we focused on surgical branch professionals (anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses) as organized in a strict hierarchy. We explored the association between the position within the organizational hierarchy in operating theaters and well-being. Data were collected in 2 parts as cross-sectional (baseline) and daily surveys (for 15 days). A total of 226 participants participated in the baseline study and 156 participants in the daily surveys. How hierarchical positions, in-group identification and personality traits were related to the well-being and experiences of surgical team members were investigated. System justification, social dominance orientation, and personality theories were used to investigate personality traits. Emotional stability and identification with other healthcare professionals were positively associated with positive experience and well-being. Daily hierarchical relationship when the team members were in a superior position was positively associated with that day's well-being, positive experience, enjoying working, and motivation to work on the following day. Conversely, the negative effects of daily hierarchical relationships on outcomes were not seen when the participants were in a subordinate position. Our findings were parallel to the literature that perceived autonomy in the workplace has positive impacts on the well-being. Furthermore, we found that in-group identification can protect surgical branch professionals from the adverse effects of the organizational hierarchy. We suppose our findings can contribute to the literature to evaluate organizational structure of operating theaters.","Tümer Murat, Dalgar İlker",Medicine,2024,38457579,PMC10919512,10.1097/MD.0000000000037327,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38457579,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10919512,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Effect of intravenous lidocaine on the ED50 of propofol induction dose in elderly patients undergoing painless gastroscopy: a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study.","Intravenous lidocaine could be a potential alternative adjuvant to propofol-based sedation for gastroscopy in elderly patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on the median effective dose (ED50) of propofol induction dose in elderly patients undergoing painless gastroscopy. The study included 70 patients aged ≥ 60 years undergoing painless gastroscopy with 64 randomly assigned to either group L (2% lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg, n = 31) or group N (equal volume normal saline, n = 33). All patients received propofol induction following 0.1 μg/kg intravenous sufentanil. The Dixon ""up-and-down"" sequential method was used, with a 1.5 mg/kg initial induction dose of propofol followed by a 0.1 mg/kg sequential variable dose. The primary endpoint was the ED50 of the propofol induction dose. The total propofol dose, recovery time, adverse events, and local anesthetic intoxication reactions were also recorded. The ED50 of propofol induction dose was 0.670 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.216-0.827) mg/kg in group L and 1.118 (95% CI 0.803-1.232) mg/kg in group N. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.001). The incidence of hypotension and propofol injection pain were lower in group L than in group N (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the orientation recovery time in group L was shorter compared to group N (p < 0.05). None of the participants in group L observed local anesthetic intoxication reactions after receiving lidocaine. The administration of intravenous lidocaine to elderly patients undergoing painless gastroscopy resulted in a significant 40% reduction in the ED50 of propofol induction dose, which may be related to the decreased incidence of hypotension and injection pain, as well as the improved post-gastroscopy orientation recovery.

Effect of different anesthetic modalities with multimodal analgesia on postoperative pain level in colorectal tumor patients.,"According to clinical data, a significant percentage of patients experience pain after surgery, highlighting the importance of alleviating postoperative pain. The current approach involves intravenous self-control analgesia, often utilizing opioid analgesics such as morphine, sufentanil, and fentanyl. Surgery for colorectal cancer typically involves general anesthesia. Therefore, optimizing anesthetic management and postoperative analgesic programs can effectively reduce perioperative stress and enhance postoperative recovery. The study aims to analyze the impact of different anesthesia modalities with multimodal analgesia on patients' postoperative pain. To explore the effects of different anesthesia methods coupled with multi-mode analgesia on postoperative pain in patients with colorectal cancer. Following the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, a total of 126 patients with colorectal cancer admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to December 2022 were included, of which 63 received general anesthesia coupled with multi-mode labor pain and were set as the control group, and 63 received general anesthesia associated with epidural anesthesia coupled with multi-mode labor pain and were set as the research group. After data collection, the effects of postoperative analgesia, sedation, and recovery were compared.

Quantitative assessment of carotid ultrasound diameter measurements in the operating room: a comparable analysis of long-axis versus rotated and tilted orientation.,"<i>Objective</i>. Carotid ultrasound (US) has been studied as a non-invasive alternative for hemodynamic monitoring. A long-axis (LA) view is traditionally employed but is difficult to maintain and operator experience may impact the diameter estimates, making it unsuitable for monitoring. Preliminary results show that a new, i.e. rotated and tilted (RT) view is more robust to motion and less operator-dependent. This study aimed to quantitatively assess common carotid diameter estimates obtained in a clinical setting from an RT view and compare those to corresponding estimates obtained using other views.<i>Approach</i>. Carotid US measurements were performed in 30 adult cardiac-surgery patients (26 males, 4 females) with short-axis (SA), LA, and RT probe orientations, the first being used as a reference for measuring the true vessel diameter. Per 30 s acquisition, the median and spread in diameter values were computed, the latter representing a measure of robustness, and were statistically compared between views.<i>Main results</i>. The median (IQR) over all the patients of the median diameter per 30 s acquisition was 7.15 (1.15) mm for the SA view, 7.03 (1.51) mm for the LA view, and 6.99 (1.72) mm for the RT view. The median spread in diameter values was 0.18 mm for the SA view, 0.16 mm for the LA view, and 0.18 mm for the RT view. There were no statistically significant differences between views in the median diameter values (<i>p</i>= 0.088) or spread (<i>p</i>= 0.122).<i>Significance</i>.

The yield of blood cultures in demonstrating the causative microbiological agent was 24.3% (90), and it was 57, 1% (212) when evaluating all types of cultures. Statistically significant positive differences were observed in the mean value of the PCT between the group that obtained positive cultures and the group that did not (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The AUC-ROC of PCT values as a guide to the causal bacteria type was 0.68 (95%CI: 0.57-0.78, <i>p</i> < 0.0021). The PCT value that showed the best diagnostic characteristics for identifying Gram-negative rods (GNR) as the causative agent in blood cultures was 2.1 ng/mL. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 78, 9% (66.3-88.1%). The AUC-ROC of the PCT values for sepsis diagnosis, with any positive culture that could be assessed, was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.63-0.73, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The PCT value that showed the best diagnostic characteristic for predicting sepsis was 3.6 ng/mL.","Gómez Natalia Fernanda Pascual, Del Pilar Sanz Martín María, Chong María Auxiliadora Semiglia, Cruz Nelly Daniela Zurita, Hernández Rosa Méndez, Molina Iñigo Guerra, Sanz Iñigo García, Tejerina Angels Figuerola, Rueda Fernando Ramasco",Journal of personalized medicine,2024,38392641,PMC10890570,10.3390/jpm14020208,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38392641,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10890570,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction-current research progress.,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) commonly occurs after surgery, particularly in elderly individuals. It is characterized by a notable decline in cognitive performance, encompassing memory, attention, coordination, orientation, verbal fluency, and executive function. This reduction in cognitive abilities contributes to extended hospital stays and heightened mortality. The prevalence of POCD can reach 40% within 1 week following cardiovascular surgery and remains as high as 17% 3 months post-surgery. Furthermore, POCD exacerbates the long-term risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying POCD and potential preventive strategies. This article provides a review of the research progress on POCD.","Zhao Qi, Wan Hui, Pan Hui, Xu Yiquan",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2024,38357422,PMC10865506,10.3389/fnbeh.2024.1328790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38357422,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10865506,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Early exposure to anesthesiology: a summer preceptorship program for first-year medical students.,"A 4-week summer preceptorship offered first-year medical students early exposure to anesthesiology following their preclerkship courses in pharmacology and cardiopulmonary physiology. The main objective was to provide students with clinical skills and prepare them for rotations while immersing them in a unique experience, introducing a specialty not covered in core rotations. Participants were selected via their responses to an application. In addition to shadowing anesthesiologists, curriculum components included weekly faculty lectures on core aspects of anesthesiology (introductory basics, perioperative drugs, airway, and crisis management); multiple simulation labs (workstation setup, intubation clinics, intravenous and central line placement, ultrasound techniques); research opportunities; and mentorship from physicians and senior medical students. The program culminated in each student successfully leading a simulated case to receive a certificate of completion. A survey of 15 participants revealed significant improvements in ability to intubate (<i>P</i> < 0.05), ability to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (<i>P</i> < 0.05), interest in anesthesiology as a specialty (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and preparedness for future rotations (<i>P</i> < 0.05). This program accelerates clinical exposure for preclerkship students, providing insights into anesthesiology early in their medical journey.

The Equipoise Ruler: A National Survey on Surgeon Judgment About the Value of Surgery.,"To understand professional norms regarding the value of surgery. Agreed-upon professional norms may improve surgical decision-making by contextualizing the nature of surgical treatment for patients. However, the extent to which these norms exist among surgeons practicing in the United States is not known. We administered a survey with 30 exemplar cases asking surgeons to use their best judgment to place each case on a scale ranging from ""definitely would do this surgery"" to ""definitely would not do this surgery."" We then asked surgeons to repeat their assessments after providing responses from the first survey. We interviewed respondents to characterize their rationale. We received 580 responses, a response rate of 28.5%. For 19 of 30 cases, there was consensus (≥60% agreement) about the value of surgery (range: 63% to 99%). There was little within-case variation when the mode was for surgery and more variation when the mode was against surgery or equipoise. Exposure to peer response increased the number of cases with consensus. Women were more likely to endorse a nonoperative approach when treatment had high mortality. Specialists were less likely to operate for salvage procedures. Surgeons noted their clinical practice was to withhold judgment and let patients decide despite their assessment. Professional judgment about the value of surgery exists along a continuum. While there is less variation in judgment for cases that are highly beneficial, consensus can be improved by exposure to the assessments of peers.","Zychowski Karlie L, Stalter Lily N, Erb Bethany M, Hanlon Bret M, Bushaw Kyle J, Buffington Anne, Bradley Taylor, Arnold Robert M, Clapp Justin, Kruser Jacqueline M, Schwarze Margaret L",Annals of surgery,2024,38328985,PMC11306411,10.1097/SLA.0000000000006230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38328985,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11306411,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Right Versus Left Cuff Position for Upper Airway Stimulation.,"Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is a treatment option for obstructive sleep apnea in which electrical stimulation is applied to the hypoglossal nerve. Nerve branches that control tongue protrusion are located inferiorly. Due to positioning, left-sided implants are typically placed with an inferiorly oriented electrode cuff (L-down) as opposed to superiorly on the right (R-up). In this study, we assess the impact of left- versus right-sided UAS on patient outcomes. Retrospective cohort study. Tertiary Academic Medical Center. Patients who underwent UAS implantation between 2016 and 2021 with an L-down or R-up oriented cuff as confirmed by X-ray were included. Data were collected retrospectively. Most recent sleep study variables were used for analysis. A total of 190 patients met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 61.0 ± 11.0 years, with 55 (28.9%) females. L-down orientation was present in 21 (11.1%) patients vs 169 (88.9%) R-up. Indications for L-down included hunting/shooting (n = 15), prior radiation/surgery (n = 4), central port (n = 1), and brachial plexus injury (n = 1). Adherence was higher among L-down patients (47.1 vs 41.0 hours use/week, P = .037) in univariate analysis, with a similar time to adherence data collection (4.4 vs 4.2 months, P = .612), though this finding was not maintained in the multivariate regression analysis. Decrease in apnea-hypopnea index (21.3 vs 22.8, P = .734), treatment success (76.5% vs 84.0%, P = .665), functional threshold (1.5 vs 1.6, P = .550), therapeutic amplitude (2.3 vs 2.4, P = .882), and decrease in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (4.9 vs 2.6, P = .060) were not significantly different between cohorts. This study is the first to examine the orientation of the UAS electrode cuff concerning the electrodes' natural position and the potential effect on postoperative outcomes. Our study found no significantly different treatment outcomes between the L-down versus R-up cohort, with the exception of device adherence, which was significantly higher in the L-down group on univariate analysis though not on multivariate analysis. Future studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to further investigate this potential relationship between treatment outcomes and electrode cuff orientation.","Arambula Alexandra M, Bon-Nieves Antonio, Alapati Rahul, Wei Johnny, Wagoner Sarah, Lawrence Amelia, Renslo Bryan, Rouse David, Larsen Christopher",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2024,38308558,,10.1002/ohn.668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38308558,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Women in Anesthesiology and the Mid-Career Stall: Why They Are Not Advancing Into Senior Leadership.,"Women anesthesiologists face many challenges when trying to advance their careers and find balance in personal and professional endeavors. In this article, we introduce the reader to several concepts central to understanding the challenges faced by mid-career women anesthesiologists and highlight why these challenges become particularly pronounced when women enter the mid-career stage. We describe how lack of constructive actionable feedback combined with lack of mentorship and sponsorship negatively affects women in the workplace. We also outline barriers and bias that mid-career women anesthesiologists face in high-level leadership roles along with the disproportionally high burden of nonpromotable work. We present a discussion of mistreatment and burnout, which are compounded by concurrent demands of parenthood and a professional career. We conclude with the impact that these barriers have on mid-career women anesthesiologists and recommendations for mitigating these challenges. They include a systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, an individualized professional development strategy, and an improved and comprehensive approach to promotion.","Mondal Samhati, Oakes Daryl, Humphrey Tara, Kolarczyk Lavinia, Trzcinka Agnieszka",Anesthesia and analgesia,2024,38289857,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38289857,,TRUE,"Systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, individualized professional development strategy, and improved approach to promotion",Mid-career women anesthesiologists,Advancement into senior leadership positions and mitigation of career challenges,TRUE,"Systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, individualized professional development strategy, improved and comprehensive approach to promotion",Mid-career women anesthesiologists,"Mitigating challenges faced by mid-career women anesthesiologists, advancement into senior leadership roles"
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Situs Inversus Totalis with Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease: A Case Report.,"Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly in which the abdominal and thoracic organs are transposed in a mirror image. Diagnosis and management of cholelithiasis in patients with situs inversus totalis pose a challenge due to the anatomical variation. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy in such a case can be technically challenging, especially for a right-handed surgeon. In this case report, we present a case of a 38-year-old male with symptomatic cholelithiasis in a chronic kidney disease stage five patient under maintenance hemodialysis planned for recipient renal transplant. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy considered the gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis was performed with a three-port technique.

Toward a Future Orientation: A Supportive Mental Health Facility Environment.,"The provision of supportive environments is essential in clinical and environmental psychology. Mental health disorders are a major issue, and the experience of being at a mental health facility is affected by numerous factors related to the building's design. The aim of this study is to explore the expectations of a mental health facility planning group regarding the potential impact of a supportive design on patients' mental health and staff's therapeutic practices when planning and designing a new mental health facility. The new mental health facility is a case study and data were collected through qualitative in-depth interviews with nine participants and analyzed using a thematic analysis. The participants came from a mental health facility planning group in a new mental health facility in Norway. The overall expectation of the new building was related to a future orientation to support patients' mental health and therapeutic practices. Three main themes were identified: toward a future orientation, supportive building design, and work environment. Supportive environments are expected to influence patients' mental health and staff's therapeutic practices, including providing options for novel treatment needs in contrast to older and more outdated buildings that are perceived as hindering appropriate treatment conditions.","Hagerup Anne, Wijk Helle, Lindahl Göran, Olausson Sepideh",HERD,2024,38259241,PMC11080379,10.1177/19375867231221151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38259241,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11080379,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Early postoperative neurocognitive complications in elderly patients: comparing those with and without preexisting mild cognitive impairment- a prospective study.,"As societies age, increasing numbers of older adults undergo surgeries with anesthesia. Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) frequently occur in older surgical patients. Most of these patients already have preoperative mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the correlation between MCI and POD remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the incidence of POD in elderly patients with and without preexisting MCI. A prospective study enrolled patients aged 60 years and above scheduled for major surgeries between December 2017 and April 2022. Preoperative MCI was determined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score between 18 and 24. POD was diagnosed using criteria from the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). POCD was characterized by a MoCA score reduction of 2 or more points from the preoperative score. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD within the first 72 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes encompassed other postoperative complications, including POCD. The study comprised 223 elderly patients with MCI and 56 without MCI. The incidence of POD was 16.6% in the MCI group and 14.3% in the non-MCI group (P = 0.839). POCD occurred in 24.3% of MCI patients and 50% of non-MCI patients (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in other postoperative complications between the groups. Postoperatively, the MCI group notably declined in visuospatial, attention, and orientation domains, while the non-MCI group declined in all domains except delayed recall. The incidence of POD was similar in the MCI and non-MCI groups. However, the non-MCI group demonstrated a higher incidence of POCD than the MCI group. This was identified by a reduction in postoperative MoCA scores for the visuospatial, naming, attention, language, abstraction, and orientation domains. These findings underscore the importance of postoperative cognitive assessments for both elderly patients with preexisting MCI and those with previously intact cognitive functions. This trial was retrospectively registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry on 15/01/2019 (registration number: TCTR20190115001).","Somnuke Pawit, Srishewachart Pensiri, Jiraphorncharas Chalita, Khempetch Asamaporn, Weeranithan Jirapa, Suraarunsumrit Patumporn, Srinonprasert Varalak, Siriussawakul Arunotai",BMC geriatrics,2024,38253999,PMC10804619,10.1186/s12877-024-04663-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38253999,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10804619,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Selecting an Ecological Momentary Assessment Platform: Tutorial for Researchers.,"Although ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been applied in psychological research for decades, delivery methods have evolved with the proliferation of digital technology. Technological advances have engendered opportunities for enhanced accessibility, convenience, measurement precision, and integration with wearable sensors. Notwithstanding, researchers must navigate novel complexities in EMA research design and implementation. In this paper, we aimed to provide guidance on platform selection for clinical scientists launching EMA studies. Our team includes diverse specialties in child and adolescent behavioral and mental health with varying expertise on EMA platforms (eg, users and developers). We (2 research sites) evaluated EMA platforms with the goal of identifying the platform or platforms with the best fit for our research. We created a list of extant EMA platforms; conducted a web-based review; considered institutional security, privacy, and data management requirements; met with developers; and evaluated each of the candidate EMA platforms for 1 week. We selected 2 different EMA platforms, rather than a single platform, for use at our 2 research sites. Our results underscore the importance of platform selection driven by individualized and prioritized laboratory needs; there is no single, ideal platform for EMA researchers. In addition, our project generated 11 considerations for researchers in selecting an EMA platform: (1) location; (2) developer involvement; (3) sample characteristics; (4) onboarding; (5) survey design features; (6) sampling scheme and scheduling; (7) viewing results; (8) dashboards; (9) security, privacy, and data management; (10) pricing and cost structure; and (11) future directions. Furthermore, our project yielded a suggested timeline for the EMA platform selection process. This study will guide scientists initiating studies using EMA, an in vivo, real-time research tool with tremendous promise for facilitating advances in psychological assessment and intervention.","Henry Lauren M, Hansen Eleanor, Chimoff Justin, Pokstis Kimberly, Kiderman Miryam, Naim Reut, Kossowsky Joe, Byrne Meghan E, Lopez-Guzman Silvia, Kircanski Katharina, Pine Daniel S, Brotman Melissa A",Journal of medical Internet research,2024,38175682,PMC10797510,10.2196/51125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38175682,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10797510,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Thoracoscopic Resection of Pulmonary Lesions in Israel: The Mentorship Approach.,"Most congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) are detected antenatally. The majority of newborns are asymptomatic. Patients are prone to subsequent respiratory complications and to a lesser extent malignant transformation remains concerning. In Israel, until 2013, pediatric surgeries were performed by thoracotomy. To minimize its morbidity, we introduced thoracoscopy using a mentorship approach. We present our experience with thoracoscopic resections coordinated by the mentorship of a pediatric worldwide leader in his field and compare our results with resections performed by thoracotomy. A retrospective review of records of children operated between 2013 and 2020 was conducted. Data were compared using <i>t</i>-test for quantitative variables. Fifty patients were operated by thoracoscopy with a median age of 4 years, a thoracoscopic lobectomy performed in 68%. There was no conversion with a median length of stay (LOS) of 3½ days. Thirty patients were operated by thoracotomy by a thoracic surgeon with a median age of 3.5 years. A lobectomy was performed in 87% with a median LOS of 7 days. Thoracoscopic lobectomy is a technically demanding procedure with a long learning curve, strongly related to the low volume of cases. The role of a mentorship program in acquiring those surgical skills is crucial through standardization of the technique applied and supervised by the mentor. Early thoracoscopy for congenital pulmonary lesions at an early age can be achieved with a low conversion rate and minimal complications creating a change in the paradigm of practice when considering surgery for CPAM in Israel.","Seguier-Lipszyc Emmanuelle, Rothenberg S, Mei-Zahav Meir, Stafler Patrick, Zeitlin Yelena, Samuk Inbal, Peysakhovich Yuri, Kravarusic Dragan",Journal of Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons,2023,38173630,PMC10760613,10.4103/jiaps.jiaps_115_23,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38173630,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10760613,TRUE,Mentorship approach with a pediatric worldwide leader supervising thoracoscopic techniques,Pediatric surgeons in Israel learning thoracoscopic resection techniques,Acquisition of thoracoscopic surgical skills with low conversion rates and minimal complications for congenital pulmonary lesions,TRUE,Mentorship approach in thoracoscopic resections,Pediatric surgeons performing thoracoscopic resections,"Acquisition of surgical skills, standardization of the technique, low conversion rate and minimal complications"
Implementation of an Un-Pairing Passport to Improve the Transition From Intern to Resident During a Critical Period of Anesthesiology Residency Training.,"The transition from intern year to the first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1) is a challenging period for residents and their supervisors. Orientation methods and instructional material targeting this transition vary across U.S. residency programs. An un-pairing passport was implemented during the 2021-2022 transition to guide and provide expectations for interns, senior residents, and staff. The objective of this quality improvement project was to assess the effectiveness of the passport in improving the transition period and overall preparedness of the new CA-1s. We surveyed 3 groups (CA-1s, CA-2s/CA-3s, and staff anesthesiologists) 6 months after the completion of passport implementation to retrospectively assess the 2021-2022 CA-1 class's preparedness across 7 domains compared with those who transitioned before passport implementation. Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> statistics and median effect sizes were used to compare pre- and postintervention. Self-reflected preparedness scores of the CA-1s were higher across all domains compared with the senior resident group (r = 0.328-0.548). Overall level of comfort and preparedness for the start of the CA-1 year was higher in the postintervention group (r = 0.162- 0.514). Staff anesthesiologists' perceived preparedness of the residents was also higher across all domains for the postintervention group (r = 0.197-0.387). The un-pairing passport improved residents' and staff anesthesiologists' subjective assessments of the readiness of new CA-1 residents after a critical transition in their training. Similar tools can be more broadly applied to other anesthesiology residency and possibly fellowship programs as well as subspecialty rotations within those programs.","Soppe Ashley N, Hauser Joshua M, Jacobson Andrew R, McElrath Angela D",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2023,38162707,PMC10753154,10.46374/volxxv_issue4_Soppe,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38162707,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10753154,TRUE,Un-pairing passport implementation to guide and provide expectations during transition from intern to CA-1 year,Anesthesiology residents transitioning from intern year to first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1),Improved preparedness and comfort of new CA-1 residents during the critical transition period,TRUE,"Implementation of an un-pairing passport to guide and provide expectations for interns, senior residents, and staff during the transition from intern year to the first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1).","Interns transitioning to the first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1), senior residents, and staff anesthesiologists.",Improved transition period and overall preparedness of the new CA-1s.

Drivers of Well-Being and Burnout in Anesthesiology Residents.,"With more than 50% of anesthesiology residents reporting burnout, many residency programs have begun creating wellness programs to address burnout and promote well-being. However, to date, many wellness initiatives have focused on individual strategies rather than systems approaches to improve the learning environment. Individual-focused interventions in the absence of systematic efforts can lead to resentment, resistance, and worsening burnout and precipitate a loss of trust in leadership and the organization. Here, we describe a process to engage anesthesiology residents, who are key stakeholders, by exploring their perspectives on burnout and well-being to better inform systematic interventions to improve the clinical work and learning environments. We conducted semistructured interviews with second- and third-year clinical anesthesia residents at the University of California, San Francisco, using the areas of worklife model as sensitizing concepts. We conducted a thematic analysis on transcribed interviews grounded in constructivist orientation. We identified the following 3 major categories of themes based on interviews with 10 residents: (1) definition of well-being, (2) challenges to well-being, and (3) strategies for coping with challenges and burnout. Challenges described by anesthesiology residents align with the areas of the worklife model, with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic precipitating additional threats in the domains of workload and community. Anesthesiology residents' definition of well-being includes both individual (resilience) and systemic (meaning in work, job autonomy, and control) factors, reaffirming that positive work and learning environments are critical to professional well-being.","Tan Michael, Naegle Jeanine A, Boscardin Christy K, Chang Denise P, Chang Joyce M, Sullivan Kristina R, Sinskey Jina L",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2023,38162705,PMC10753163,10.46374/volxxv_issue4_Boscardin,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38162705,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10753163,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Trends in Gender of Authors of Patient Blood Management Publications.,"Diverse representation in the field of patient blood management (PBM) may help bring varying perspectives to improve patient care. We assessed trends in gender of first and last authorship of recent PBM publications to evaluate diversity within the field. Publications from 10 high-impact anesthesiology and blood transfusion medicine journals between 2017 and 2021 were reviewed using 19 keywords to identify PBM-related articles. Each publication title was reviewed independently to determine whether it met the inclusion criteria. A software program was used to identify the gender of each first and last author for the most common first names. Author gender that could not be identified through this process was determined by querying institutional websites and professional social networks (eg, ResearchGate). Any publication where the gender of the first and/or last author could not be reliably determined was excluded from the analysis. Trends over time were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test. A total of 2467 publications met the inclusion criteria of the 2873 yielded by the initial search. Gender of the first and last author was identified for 2384 of these publications and included in the final analysis. Approximately 42.8% of publications featured a woman as the first author with the highest from the journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) (48.7%) and Transfusion (48.1%) and the lowest from the journals such as the British Journal of Anaesthesia (24.1%) and Anesthesia & Analgesia (24.4%). Approximately 32.0% of the publications featured a woman as the last author with the highest being Transfusion (36.9%) and Anaesthesia (31.8%) and the lowest being Anesthesia and Analgesia (18.3%) and Anesthesiology (18.6%). Approximately 57.6% of publications had either a woman as the first or last author while 16.3% of the publications had women as both the first and last authors. Women authors comprised 32.6% of the publications with a single author. Women as the first or last authors did not change significantly over the study period ( P = .115 and P = .119, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the percentage of PBM articles with a woman as the first or last author, a woman as the first and last author, or a woman as a single author from 2017 to 2021 ( P = .089, P = .055, and P = .226, respectively).

Clinical and structural outcomes of neocommissural alignment in transaxillary and transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a self-expandable transcatheter heart valve.,"This study analyzes neocommissural alignment and the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes after transaxillary and transcarotid implantation of the Acurate neo2 transcatheter heart valve. We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of early outcomes after transaxillary and transcarotid implantation of the Acurate neo2 transcatheter heart valve. Primary outcomes were neocommisural alignment, in-hospital mortality, and valve hemodynamic performance. Commissural alignment between native and transcatheter heart valves was assessed by transesophageal echocardiogram before and after the procedure. Between October 2021 and November 2022, 40 consecutive patients were treated with the Acurate neo2 through a transaxillary or transcarotid approach. Access was achieved via the left subclavian artery in 30 cases and the left common carotid artery in 10 cases, with a mean vessel diameter of 6.7 mm. Implants most commonly used were size M (37.5%), L (35%), and S (27.5%). On the basis of transesophageal echocardiogram analysis, there was no significant difference in mean commissural orientation between native (mean, 65.1°; SD, 41.3°) and neocommissures (mean, 64°; SD, 44.1°) (<i>P</i> = .661). Mean commissural orientation did not significantly differ between native and neocommissures (<i>P</i> = .661). Optimal alignment or mild commissural misalignment was achieved in 99.5% of cases. There were no cases of severe commissural misalignment. Postprocedural mean values for peak and mean gradients were 12.7 mm Hg and 5.2 mm Hg, respectively. There were 2 cases of moderate paravalvular leak and 4 cases of mild paravalvular leak. This patient-specific technique for transaxillary and transcarotid insertion of the Acurate neo2 delivery system prevents implantations with more than mild commissural misalignment and with a high device success rate.","Mosquera Victor X, Muinelo-Paul Adrian, Pato-López Oscar, Bouzas-Mosquera Alberto, Cuenca-Castillo José J",JTCVS techniques,2023,38152173,PMC10750428,10.1016/j.xjtc.2023.06.017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38152173,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10750428,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Natural Products Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 2B6 Activity and Methadone Metabolism.,"Methadone is cleared predominately by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6-catalyzed metabolism to inactive metabolites. CYP2B6 also catalyzes the metabolism of several other drugs. Methadone and CYP2B6 are susceptible to pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Use of natural products such as herbals and other botanicals is substantial and growing, and concomitant use of prescription medicines and non-prescription herbals is common and may result in interactions, often precipitated by CYP inhibition. Little is known about herbal product effects on CYP2B6 activity, and CYP2B6-catalyzed methadone metabolism. We screened a family of natural product compounds used in traditional medicines, herbal teas, and synthetic analogs of compounds found in plants, including kavalactones, flavokavains, chalcones and gambogic acid, for inhibition of expressed CYP2B6 activity and specifically inhibition of CYP2B6-mediated methadone metabolism. An initial screen evaluated inhibition of CYP2B6-catalyzed 7-ethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl) coumarin O-deethylation. Hits were further evaluated for inhibition of racemic methadone metabolism, including mechanism of inhibition and kinetic constants. In order of decreasing potency, the most effective inhibitors of methadone metabolism were dihydromethysticin (competitive, <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> 0.074 <i>µ</i>M), gambogic acid (noncompetitive, <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> 6 <i>µ</i>M), and 2,2'-dihydroxychalcone (noncompetitive, <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> 16 <i>µ</i>M). Molecular modeling of CYP2B6-methadone and inhibitor binding showed substrate and inhibitor binding position and orientation and their interactions with CYP2B6 residues. These results show that CYP2B6 and CYP2B6-catalyzed methadone metabolism are inhibited by certain natural products, at concentrations which may be clinically relevant. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This investigation identified several natural product constituents which inhibit <i>in vitro</i> human recombinant CYP2B6 and CYP2B6-catalyzed N-demethylation of the opioid methadone. The most potent inhibitors (<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub>) were dihydromethysticin (0.074 µM), gambogic acid (6 µM) and 2,2'-dihydroxychalcone (16 µM). Molecular modeling of ligand interactions with CYP2B6 found that dihydromethysticin and 2,2'-dihydroxychalcone bound at the active site, while gambogic acid interacted with an allosteric site on the CYP2B6 surface. Natural product constituents may inhibit CYP2B6 and methadone metabolism at clinically relevant concentrations.","Wang Pan-Fen, Yang Yanming, Patel Vishal, Neiner Alicia, Kharasch Evan D",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2024,38135504,PMC10877711,10.1124/dmd.123.001578,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38135504,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10877711,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Association between an anesthesia department development program for junior faculty and long-term production of publications: A longitudinal cohort study.,"An important mission of academic medical departments is to further the scholarship and education of its junior faculty. In 2013, Hindman et al. described the design and initial outcomes of a faculty development program for junior faculty at the University of Iowa Department of Anesthesia. In the current study, we reassessed whether the program increased the production of publications long-term. We included all department faculty, years before joining the department, and years after leaving the department, to control for the effects of simply being current faculty in the department, benefiting from its resources, and having had progressively more experience working. The population studied was the faculty for any period between January 2006 and December 2022. The dependent variable was the count of publications in Scopus each year with the faculty member's Scopus identifier, 1996 through 2022. The two-year faculty development program included non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies. Statistical analyses were with logistic and Poisson random effect models for panel data, with standard errors estimated using jackknife resampling. Among the 128 distinct faculty in the department from 2006 through 2022, the 10% with the most publications per year accounted for 54% of the total annual publications. The two-year program was completed by 41% (53/128). Completion of the faculty development program was associated with a 17% absolute increase in the predicted marginal probability of one or more publications per year, from 25% to 41%. The 95% confidence interval for the 17% absolute increase was 9% to 24% (P < .0001). The predictive marginal effect of completing the program was 1.7 more publications per year per faculty (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.4, P < .0001). The estimate was also 1.7 more publications per year while limiting consideration to the 108 faculty who joined the department after 1996 and including as an independent variable the count of publications the year before joining the department. A faculty development program for junior faculty can reliably increase the production of publications in an anesthesiology department by at least one per year. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in publication production among faculty.","Dexter Franklin, Epstein Richard H, Hindman Bradley J",Journal of clinical anesthesia,2024,38133566,,10.1016/j.jclinane.2023.111308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38133566,,TRUE,"Two-year faculty development program including non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies",Junior faculty in an anesthesiology department,Increased production of publications,TRUE,"The two-year faculty development program included non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies.",Junior faculty at the University of Iowa Department of Anesthesia,"Completion of the faculty development program was associated with a 17% absolute increase in the predicted marginal probability of one or more publications per year, from 25% to 41%.

Clinician responses to disruptive intraoperative behaviour: patterns and norms identified from a multinational survey.,"Disruptive intraoperative behaviour can have detrimental consequences for clinicians, institutions, and patients. The way victims and witnesses respond to disruptive behaviour can ameliorate or exacerbate consequences. Nevertheless, previous research has neither described the responses of a multinational sample of clinicians nor developed tools to recognize and evaluate responses. After obtaining ethics committee approval, 23 perioperative organizations distributed a survey evaluating clinician responses to disruptive behaviour. We grouped responses into four response strategies: passive, assertive, manipulative, and malicious. Thereafter, we derived norms (i.e., percentile distributions) for each response strategy using empirical distribution functions. Latent profile analysis identified groups of clinicians balancing their use of the four response strategies differently (i.e., response pattern groups). We used Chi square tests to examine associations between response pattern groups and respondent demographics. We analyzed 4,789 complete responses. In response to disruptive behaviour, 33.7% of clinicians altered medical care in ways that were unindicated, 54.6% avoided communication with team members, and 12.1% misled the offender. Profile analysis identified five response pattern groups: extreme passive-predominant (30.5% of clinicians), extreme assertive-predominant (20.5%), moderate passive-predominant (18.9%), moderate assertive-predominant (26.5%), and a disparate pattern (greater use of manipulative and malicious responses) (3.5%). Profession, sex, management responsibilities, and sexual orientation predicted the response pattern group (all, P < 0.001). The responses of thousands of clinicians involved passivity, manipulativeness, or maliciousness. We present norms and a response pattern classification to help organizations evaluate responses, recognize response patterns, and provide tailored support to victims and witnesses.","Villafranca Alexander, Fast Ian, Turick Michelle, Jacobsohn Eric",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2024,38129359,,10.1007/s12630-023-02670-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38129359,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Analysis of a Needs Assessment Survey to Develop an Online Resource Repository Supporting Nurse Anesthesia Educators.,"Without highly qualified nurse anesthesia educators and administrators, the health care system will be threatened by the inadequate supply of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). American Association of Nurse Anesthesiologists' Faculty Stabilization Task Force (FSTF) analyzed reasons for high faculty turnover and developed recommendations to support nurse anesthesia faculty and administrators. A survey evaluated participants' current role, leadership development opportunities, mentorship experiences, and resource needs. Of 109 respondents, 87 (80%) were program administrators or assistant administrators with less than 5 years of experience in their role. Despite academic experience, 51% felt adequately prepared for their role. The FSTF provided 2 recommendations: to create a robust faculty development program for all faculty at all levels of CRNA education and a repository of information needed for program administrators and faculty to oversee and educate students in a high-quality CRNA program.","Lee Rebecca, Bonanno Laura, O'Sullivan Cormac, Anderson Michael, Everson Marjorie, Moore Erica, O'Guin Crystal, Thompson Judy, Morgan Brett, Greenier Ewa, Pantone Gina",Nurse educator,,38113930,,10.1097/NNE.0000000000001559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38113930,,TRUE,Creating a repository of information and a robust faculty development program,Nurse anesthesia educators and administrators (CRNAs),"Better preparation for roles, reduced faculty turnover, and high-quality CRNA education programs",TRUE,Creation of a robust faculty development program and a repository of information needed for program administrators and faculty,"Nurse anesthesia educators and administrators, particularly those with less than 5 years of experience in their role","Better preparation and support for nurse anesthesia faculty and administrators, leading to improved oversight and education of students in high-quality CRNA programs"
"Chronic overlapping pain conditions increase the risk of long COVID features, regardless of acute COVID status.","Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) refer to conditions that have similar central nervous system pathophysiologic mechanisms driving widespread pain as well as common comorbid symptoms such as fatigue and problems with sleep, memory, and mood. If COPCs predict the onset of long COVID, this could offer a valuable orientation for long COVID-related research and clinical care. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether having a COPC predicts the onset of long COVID features using US electronic health records and 1:1 propensity score matching without replacement. The study cohorts included (1) people with acute COVID (n = 1,038,402), (2) people with acute influenza (n = 262,092), and (3) a noninfected cohort comprising people with a routine healthcare encounter (n = 1,081,593). Having a COPC increased the risk of long COVID features in all 3 study cohorts. Among those with COVID, having a pre-existing COPC increased the risk by 1.47 (95% CI = 1.46, 1.47). In the influenza cohort, COPCs increased the risk by 1.39 (95% CI = 1.38, 1.40). In the noninfected cohort, COPCs increased the risk by 1.57 (95% CI = 1.56, 1.59). These findings reinforce the likelihood that nociplastic mechanisms play a prominent role in long COVID. Recognizing that this ubiquitous nonspecific syndrome occurs frequently in the population can inform precision medicine therapies that avoid the pitfalls of viewing long COVID exclusively in the framework of postinfectious disease.","Bergmans Rachel S, Clauw Daniel J, Flint Candace, Harris Herb, Lederman Seth, Schrepf Andrew",Pain,2024,38112577,PMC11017744,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38112577,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11017744,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Association of pain catastrophizing with labor pain and analgesia consumption in obstetrical patients.,"Pain catastrophizing is an exaggerated negative orientation to painful stimuli which in obstetric patients is associated with fear of overwhelming labor pain and negative pain-related outcomes. This study aimed to quantitatively examine the association of pain catastrophizing with maternal labor pain outcomes. We conducted a prospective observational study of women admitted for a vaginal trial of labor. Subjects completed the 13-item Pain Catastrophizing scale (PCS) questionnaire (scored 0 to 52, higher scores representing greater catastrophizing). Pain was assessed at baseline and at request for neuraxial labor analgesia. Labor and postpartum pain intensity was assessed as the average area under the pain intensity by time curve. Pain at request for analgesia, labor pain, postpartum pain, analgesic consumption, and quality of recovery was compared between high (PCS ≥ 17) and low catastrophizing groups. Data from 138/157 (88%) subjects were included in the analysis. Median (IQR) pain scores at request for analgesia were 9 (8,10) and 8 (6,9), a difference of 1 (95% CI 0 to 2.5, P = 0.008) in high-catastrophizing and in low-catastrophizing groups, respectively. Adjusted pain during labor, postpartum pain and opioid analgesic use were not significantly different. High-catastrophizers reported less comfort, ability to mobilize and less control during hospitalization. Post-discharge there were no differences in pain or analgesic use. We did not observe greater labor or post-delivery pain or increased analgesic use in high-catastrophizing parturients. High catastrophizers reported greater pain when requesting analgesia, which is consistent with the role of catastrophizing in intensifying the experience of pain.","Peralta F M, Condon L P, Torrez D, Neumann K E, Pollet A L, McCarthy R J",International journal of obstetric anesthesia,2024,38087766,,10.1016/j.ijoa.2023.103954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38087766,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Gender Differences in Plastic Surgery Trainee Confidence: A Pilot Analysis During Cleft Lip Simulation.,"Underrepresentation of women in plastic surgery remains a concern. This study investigates gender-related differences in self-confidence and surgical ability among plastic surgery trainees in an effort to work toward gender parity. Residents and fellows were recorded performing up to three cleft lip repairs on a high-fidelity simulator. Demographic information was collected, and two questionnaires were completed to assess self-confidence after each simulation. Videos were rated blindly using the objective structured assessment of technical skills and unilateral cleft lip repair competency assessment tool. Differences between participants were estimated using generalized estimating equations modeling, and correlation between overall self-confidence and performance was examined using Pearson correlation (r). Twenty-six participants (six self-identified women and 20 self-identified men) completed 73 simulated procedures. There was no gender-related difference in training level, volume of prior experience, speed with which participants completed each simulated procedure, or objective performance. However, a significant difference was found in overall procedural self-confidence, with women rating their confidence lower (mean = 16.9, SD = 4.3) than men (mean = 19.4, SD = 3.8); <i>P</i> = 0.021. Further analysis revealed that confidence scores correlated more strongly with objective performance for women (r = 0.83) than for men (r = 0.45). Women plastic surgery trainees overall reported lower self-confidence than their male counterparts, despite demonstrating at least as much skill. Confidence and skill were more closely related for women, suggesting that mentorship focused on concrete skill building may help close the confidence gap.","Stanek Krystof, Phillips Nicole, Staffa Steven J, Saldanha Francesca Y L, Rogers-Vizena Carolyn R",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

21st century (clinical) decision support in nursing and allied healthcare. Developing a learning health system: a reasoned design of a theoretical framework.,"In this paper, we present a framework for developing a Learning Health System (LHS) to provide means to a computerized clinical decision support system for allied healthcare and/or nursing professionals. LHSs are well suited to transform healthcare systems in a mission-oriented approach, and is being adopted by an increasing number of countries. Our theoretical framework provides a blueprint for organizing such a transformation with help of evidence based state of the art methodologies and techniques to eventually optimize personalized health and healthcare. Learning via health information technologies using LHS enables users to learn both individually and collectively, and independent of their location. These developments demand healthcare innovations beyond a disease focused orientation since clinical decision making in allied healthcare and nursing is mainly based on aspects of individuals' functioning, wellbeing and (dis)abilities. Developing LHSs depends heavily on intertwined social and technological innovation, and research and development. Crucial factors may be the transformation of the Internet of Things into the Internet of FAIR data & services. However, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is in up to 80% unstructured including free text narratives and stored in various inaccessible data warehouses. Enabling the use of data as a driver for learning is challenged by interoperability and reusability.To address technical needs, key enabling technologies are suitable to convert relevant health data into machine actionable data and to develop algorithms for computerized decision support. To enable data conversions, existing classification and terminology systems serve as definition providers for natural language processing through (un)supervised learning.To facilitate clinical reasoning and personalized healthcare using LHSs, the development of personomics and functionomics are useful in allied healthcare and nursing. Developing these omics will be determined via text and data mining. This will focus on the relationships between social, psychological, cultural, behavioral and economic determinants, and human functioning.Furthermore, multiparty collaboration is crucial to develop LHSs, and man-machine interaction studies are required to develop a functional design and prototype. During development, validation and maintenance of the LHS continuous attention for challenges like data-drift, ethical, technical and practical implementation difficulties is required.","van Velzen Mark, de Graaf-Waar Helen I, Ubert Tanja, van der Willigen Robert F, Muilwijk Lotte, Schmitt Maarten A, Scheper Mark C, van Meeteren Nico L U",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2023,38053104,PMC10699040,10.1186/s12911-023-02372-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38053104,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10699040,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A practical tool for managing change: cross-sectional psychometric assessment of the safe surgery organizational readiness tool.,"Strengthening health systems through planned safety and quality improvement initiatives is an imperative to achieve more equitable, resilient, and effective care. And yet, years of organizational behavior research demonstrate that change initiatives often fall short because managers fail to account for organizational readiness for change. This finding remains true especially among surgical safety and quality improvement initiatives in low-income countries and middle-income countries. In this study, our aim was to psychometrically assess the construct validity and internal consistency of the Safe Surgery Organizational Readiness Tool (SSORT), a short survey tool designed to provide change leaders with insight into facility infrastructure that supports learning and readiness to undertake change. To demonstrate generalizability and achieve a large sample size ( n =1706) to conduct exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a collaboration between seven surgical and anesthesia safety and quality improvement initiatives was formed. Collected survey data from health care workers were divided into pilot, exploration, and confirmation samples. The pilot sample was used to assess feasibility. The exploration sample was used to conduct EFA, while the confirmation sample was used to conduct CFA. Factor internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Results of the EFA retained 9 of the 16 proposed factors associated with readiness to change. CFA results of the identified 9 factor model, measured by 28 survey items, demonstrated excellent fit to data. These factors (appropriateness, resistance to change, team efficacy, team learning orientation, team valence, communication about change, learning environment, vision for sustainability, and facility capacity) were also found to be internally consistent. Our findings suggest that communication, team learning, and supportive environment are components of change readiness that can be reliably measured prior to implementation of projects that promote surgical safety and quality improvement in low-income countries and middle-income countries. Future research can link performance on identified factors to outcomes that matter most to patients.","Hayirli Tuna C, Meara John G, Abahuje Egide, Alayande Barnabas, Augustin Sylvio, Barash David, Boatin Adeline A, Kalolo Albino, Kengia James, Kingpriest Paul, Kissima Innocent, Lugazia Edwin R, Mpirimbanyi Christophe, Ngonzi Joseph, Njai Abdoulie, Smith Victoria L, Kapologwe Ntuli, Alidina Shehnaz","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2024,38051926,PMC10871570,10.1097/JS9.0000000000000888,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38051926,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10871570,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Implementing a mentoring program for clinical research professionals: A novel professional development initiative for university health research staff.,"Clinical and translational research relies on a well-trained workforce, but mentorship programs designed expressly for this workforce are lacking.

Focus groups were conducted to identify key program outcomes. Surveys were administered throughout the program period to assess participants' experience, gains in skill, and subsequent careers. Analysis of the resultant qualitative and quantitative data are used to characterize the implementation and impact of the program. A total of 47 mentees and 30 mentors participated in program between 2018 and 2023. A comprehensive logic model of short-, intermediate- and long-term outcomes was developed. Participants reported positive valuations of every programmatic outcome assessed including their program experience, learning and research careers. The pool of available mentors also grew as new mentors were successfully recruited for each cohort. This mentorship program developed and implemented by senior research staff successfully provided junior research staff with professional development support, mentorship, and professional development opportunities.

Correlates of physical activity enjoyment in children and adolescents for a new perspective on the treatment of overweight: A systematic literature review.,"The purpose of this systematic literature review was to systematically compile the state of knowledge on correlates of physical activity enjoyment in children and adolescents to influence the perspective of future physical activity promotion approaches especially for children and adolescents affected by overweight or obesity. The electronic database search was executed in the five databases PubMed, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and BISp-SURF, from inception to December 6, 2021. A semi-quantitative method was used for summarizing the resulted correlates. For final analysis, 85 studies comprising 48,144 children and adolescents were included. Fifty-seven variables could be coded for their relationship with physical activity enjoyment. Of these, 12 psychological variables, for example, the basic psychological needs, task orientation, or self-efficacy; six interpersonal variables, for example, peer/group acceptance, parental support, and autonomy support; and one behavioral variable, the higher self-reported physical activity, are consistent positively associated to physical activity enjoyment. A scientifically based overview could be extracted for the promotion of physical activity enjoyment in children and adolescents. There is a gap in literature focusing the perception of physical activity enjoyment in the subgroup of children and adolescents affected by overweight or obesity. Therefore, recommendations were made to enable the development of further innovative research approaches in this population.","Greule Constanze, Sudeck Gorden, Thiel Ansgar, Kastner Lydia, Janßen Pia, Nieß Andreas, Rapp Felicitas, Junne Florian, Krauß Inga",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2024,37987113,,10.1111/obr.13655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37987113,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Nominal logistic regression analysis of variables determining needle visibility in ultrasound images - a full factorial cadaver study.,"Needle visualization is essential to avoid vascular puncture and nerve injury in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Several factors that statistically influence needle visibility have been described but the dimensions of their individual impact remain unclear. This study aimed to quantify the impact of various independent factors on ultrasound needle visibility. A total of 1500 ultrasound videos of in-plane needle insertions were obtained in embalmed cadavers with ten different commercially available echogenic and non-echogenic needles at different insertion angles and bevel orientations in a full factorial study design. The visibility of needle tip and shaft were rated as ""good"" or ""poor"" visibility. Nominal logistic regression analyses were calculated for the visibility of the needle tip and shaft. SonoPlex Stim Sprotte, SonoTAP Facet (needle tip and shaft) and Spinostar PencilPoint (needle tip)), insertion angle and bevel orientation were associated with good ultrasound visibility, reaching statistical significance (p < 0.05). The range of the effect on the log-odds scale for needle tip visibility was largest for the insertion angle with 6.33, followed by the tissue condition (3.76), bevel orientation (1.45) and the needle types (1.25). Regarding the needle shaft visibility, the largest effect range was observed with the insertion angle (7.36), followed by the tissue conditions with 3.96, needle type (1.86) and bevel orientation (0.95). In-plane needle visibility in ultrasound images depends mainly on the insertion angle, as expected. This is closely followed by the tissue condition, which is a factor related to the patient, thus cannot be altered to improve needle visibility. In the dimensions of the log-odds scale, the choice of a specific needle is far less important towards achieving a good visualization, whereas optimizing the bevel orientation can have a larger impact than the needle choice. Concluding from the relative dimensions of factors that determine needle visibility in this model, the importance of needles with echogenic features may be overrated.","Dinges Hanns-Christian, Hoeft Julia, Cornelius Valér Michael, Steinfeldt Thorsten, Wiesmann Thomas, Wulf Hinnerk, Schubert Ann-Kristin",BMC anesthesiology,2023,37950214,PMC10636954,10.1186/s12871-023-02339-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37950214,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10636954,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effects of xenon anesthesia on postoperative neurocognitive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The latest clinical trials have reported conflicting outcomes regarding the effectiveness of xenon anesthesia in preventing postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction; thus, this study assessed the existing evidence. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception to April 9, 2023, for randomized controlled trials of xenon anesthesia in postoperative patients. We included English-language randomized controlled studies of adult patients undergoing surgery with xenon anesthesia that compared its effects to those of other anesthetics. Duplicate studies, pediatric studies, and ongoing clinical trials were excluded. Nine studies with 754 participants were identified. A forest plot revealed that the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction did not differ between the xenon anesthesia and control groups (P = 0.43). Additionally, xenon anesthesia significantly shortened the emergence time for time to opening eyes (P < 0.001), time to extubation (P < 0.001), time to react on demand (P = 0.01), and time to time and spatial orientation (P = 0.04). However, the Aldrete score significantly increased with xenon anesthesia (P = 0.005). Postoperative complications did not differ between the anesthesia groups. Egger's test for bias showed no small-study effect, and a trim-and-fill analysis showed no apparent publication bias. In conclusion, xenon anesthesia probably did not affect the occurrence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction. However, xenon anesthesia may effectively shorten the emergence time of certain parameters without adverse effects.","Yang Yu-Shen, Wu Shan-Hu, Chen Wei-Can, Pei Meng-Qin, Liu Yi-Bin, Liu Chu-Yun, Lin Shu, He He-Fan",BMC anesthesiology,2023,37946114,PMC10634138,10.1186/s12871-023-02316-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37946114,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10634138,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

In this study, we sought to determine whether the EORFs from three programs, including multiple specialties and institutions, produced useful information for residents, program directors, and CCCs. Evaluations from three programs were included (Program 1, Institution A, Internal Medicine: n = 38; Program 2, Institution A, Anesthesia: n = 9; Program 3, Institution B, Anesthesia: n = 11). Two independent researchers coded each written comment for relevance (specificity and actionability) and orientation (praise or critical) using a standardized rubric. Numeric scores were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 4869 evaluations were collected from the programs. Of the 77,434 discrete numeric scores, 691 (0.89%) were considered ""below expected level."" 71.2% (2683/3767) of the total written comments were scored as irrelevant, while 3217 (85.4%) of total comments were scored positive and 550 (14.6%) were critical. When combined, 63.2% (n = 2379) of comments were scored positive and irrelevant while 6.5% (n = 246) were scored critical and relevant. <1% of comments indicated below average performance; >70% of comments scored irrelevant. Critical, relevant comments were least frequently observed, consistent across all 3 programs. The low rate of constructive feedback and the high rate of irrelevant comments are inadequate for a CCC to make informed decisions. The consistency of these findings across programs, specialties, and institutions suggests both local and systemic changes should be considered.","Anderson Lauren M, Rowland Kathleen, Edberg Deborah, Wright Katherine M, Park Yoon Soo, Tekian Ara",Perspectives on medical education,2023,37929204,PMC10624145,10.5334/pme.41,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37929204,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10624145,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Opioid-Free Anesthesia for Pain Relief After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.,"To compare the efficacies of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) and opioid-based anesthesia (OBA) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). A total of 150 patients who underwent 3-port LC procedures were randomly divided into an OFA group with esketamine, dexmedetomidine and lidocaine intravenous combined with local anesthetic incision infiltration or an OBA group with remifentanil combined with local anesthetic incision infiltration. The primary outcome was the consumption of rescue analgesics within 24 hrs after surgery. Secondary outcomes included time to LMA removal, time to orientation recovery, time to unassisted walking, sleep quality on the night of surgery, time to first flatus, hemodynamics during induction of general anesthesia, postoperative pain level on the visual analog scale (VAS), incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and global satisfaction score (GSS) within 24 hrs after surgery. Both the consumption of rescue analgesics and the time to first flatus in the OFA group were significantly lower than those in the OBA group (<i>P</i> < 0.001 and P = 0.029, respectively). However, the time to LMA removal and the time to orientation recovery were significantly longer in the OFA group than in the OBA group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). In addition, the VAS scores at 2 hrs and 8 hrs after surgery and HR at laryngeal mask airway insertion in the OFA group were significantly lower than those in the OBA group (<i>P</i> = 0.002 and <i>P</i> = 0.001, and <i>P</i> =0.016, respectively). OFA may be beneficial for patients undergoing LC in that it could decrease the dosage of postoperative analgesics and pain intensity and even shorten the time to first flatus after surgery.","Yu Jun-Ma, Tao Qing-Yu, He Yan, Liu Dong, Niu Jing-Yi, Zhang Ye",Journal of pain research,2023,37928062,PMC10624184,10.2147/JPR.S432601,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37928062,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10624184,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Formal ultrasound curriculum for surgical critical care fellows leads to improvement in comfort and skills in the intensive care unit.,"Despite its importance, there are no official guidelines for point of care ultrasound training during surgical critical care fellowship. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the comfort and competency of fellows after implementation of a point of care ultrasound program. Surgical critical care fellows (n = 7) participated in an ultrasound rotation (2021-2022), including dedicated lectures and training with interventional and echocardiography technicians. Pre and post self-assessments were administered evaluating comfort in point of care ultrasound for focused assessment with sonography for trauma, vascular access, drainage procedures, volume status, cardiac activity during arrest, and global cardiac function. Technicians assessed fellow skill in probe orientation, location, image manipulation, machine adjustment, and image quality. All questions were answered on a 7-point Likert scale (1, not-at-all; 7, yes/very much). Pre and post cohorts were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. After the rotation, fellows reported improvement in comfort level for ultrasound-guided technique for focused assessment with sonography for trauma, drainage procedures, volume status, and cardiac assessment. Technician evaluations demonstrated improvement in probe orientation (5 [4-6] vs 7 [7-7], P = .02) and location (5 [3-6] vs 7 [7-7], P = .02), image manipulation (5 [4-5] vs 7 [7-7], P = .02), machine adjustment (5 [4-5] vs 7 [7-7], P = .02), and overall image quality (4 [4-6] vs 7 [7-7], P = .02) after the rotation. All fellows reported the course significantly improved their skill, comfort level, and was worthwhile. All fellows exhibited significant improvement in skill and comfort with point of care ultrasound after this rotation. This is the first study to describe a dedicated ultrasound curriculum for surgical critical care with significant skill acquisition.","Jalilvand Anahita, Bhatt Amar, Kopanczyk Rafal, Wahl Wendy",Surgery,2024,37926583,,10.1016/j.surg.2023.08.041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37926583,,TRUE,Dedicated ultrasound rotation including lectures and training with interventional and echocardiography technicians,Surgical critical care fellows,Improvement in comfort and competency with point of care ultrasound techniques,FALSE,,,
Application of early enteral nutrition nursing based on enhanced recovery after surgery theory in patients with digestive surgery.,"Postoperative nursing can improve the restlessness and gastrointestinal function of patients with tracheal intubation under general anesthesia in digestive surgery. Wide application of various nursing methods and routine nursing in perioperative nursing of patients with general anesthesia in digestive surgery. To investigate the impact of early postoperative enteral nutrition nursing based on the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) theory on postoperative agitation and gastrointestinal recovery in patients undergoing general anesthesia that experienced tracheal intubation. The data of 126 patients with digestive surgery from May 2019 to February 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. According to different nursing methods, they were divided into control group and observation group, with 63 cases in observation group and 63 cases in control group. The patients in the control group had standard perioperative nursing care, whereas those in the observation group got enteral nourishment as soon as possible after surgery in accordance with ERAS theory. Both the rate and quality of gastrointestinal function recovery were compared between the two groups after treatment ended. Postoperative anesthesia-related adverse events were tallied, patients' nutritional statuses were monitored, and the Riker sedation and agitation score (SAS) was used to measure the incidence of agitation. When compared to the control group, the awake duration, spontaneous breathing recovery time, extubation time and postoperative eye-opening time were all considerably shorter (<i>P</i> < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the recovery time of orientation force between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05); however, the observation group had a lower SAS score than the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The recovery time for normal intestinal sounds, the time it took to have the first postoperative exhaust, the time it took to have the first postoperative defecation, and the time it took to have the first postoperative half-fluid feeding were all faster in the observation group than in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05); Fasting blood glucose was lower in the observation group compared to the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while the albumin and hemoglobin levels were higher on the first and third postoperative days; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of anesthesia-related adverse reactions between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The extremely early postoperative enteral nutrition nursing based on ERAS theory can reduce the degree of agitation, improve the quality of recovery, promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, and improve the nutritional status of patients in the recovery period after tracheal intubation under general anesthesia.","Shao Yan-Ru, Ke Xia, Luo Li-Hua, Xu Jin-Dong, Xu Li-Qian",World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,2023,37901724,PMC10600773,10.4240/wjgs.v15.i9.1910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37901724,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10600773,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Effect of acute normovolemic hemodilution on anesthetic effect, plasma concentration, and recovery quality in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery.","To explore the effect of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) on the anesthetic effect, plasma concentration, and postoperative recovery quality in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery. A total of 60 cases of elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years who underwent elective multilevel spinal surgery were assigned randomly into the ANH group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). Hemodynamic and blood gas analysis indexes were observed and recorded before ANH (T<sub>1</sub>), after ANH (T<sub>2</sub>), immediately after postoperative autologous blood transfusion (T<sub>3</sub>), 10 min (T<sub>4</sub>), 20 min (T<sub>5</sub>), 30 min (T<sub>6</sub>), 40 min (T<sub>7</sub>), and 50 min (T<sub>8</sub>) after the transfusion, and at the end of the transfusion (i.e., 60 min; T<sub>9</sub>). At T<sub>3 ~ 9</sub>, bispectral index (BIS) and train-of-four (TOF) stimulation were recorded and the plasma propofol/cisatracurium concentration was determined. The extubation time and recovery quality were recorded. The ANH group presented a lower MAP value and a higher SVV value at T<sub>2</sub>, and shorter extubation and orientation recovery time (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. BIS values at T<sub>8</sub> and T<sub>9</sub> were lower in the ANH group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). TOF values at T<sub>7 ~ 9</sub> were lower in the ANH group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative plasma concentrations of propofol and cisatracurium between the groups (P > 0.05). During orthopedic surgery, the plasma concentration of elderly patients is increased after autologous blood transfusion of ANH, and the depth of anesthesia and muscle relaxant effect are strengthened, thus leading to delayed recovery of respiratory function and extubation.","Liu Tong, Bai Yu, Yin Lei, Wang Jin-Huo, Yao Na, You Lai-Wei, Guo Jian-Rong",BMC geriatrics,2023,37875833,PMC10598930,10.1186/s12877-023-04397-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37875833,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10598930,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Opioid Free Total Intravenous Anesthesia With Dexmedetomidine-Esketamine-Lidocaine for Patients Undergoing Lumpectomy.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of the opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) technique with dexmedetomidine, esketamine, and lidocaine among patients diagnosed with benign breast mass and scheduled for lumpectomy. We enrolled 80 female patients who were aged from 18 to 60 years, graded with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, diagnosed with benign breast mass, and scheduled for lumpectomy. These patients were randomly treated with OFA or opioid-based anesthesia (OBA). Dexmedetomidine-esketamine-lidocaine and sufentanil-remifentanil were administered in OFA and OBA group, respectively. We mainly compared the analgesic efficacy of OFA and OBA technique, as well as intraoperative hemodynamics, the quality of recovery, and satisfaction score of patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 2, 12, and 24 h after extubation. However, the time to first rescue analgesic was prolonged in OFA group than that in OFB group (6.18 ± 1.00 min vs. 7.40 ± 0.92 min, P = 0.000). Further, mean arterial pressure and heart rate at T0 (entering operating room), T1 (before anesthesia induction), T2 (immediately after intubation), T3, T4, and T5 (1, 5, and 10 min after surgical incision, respectively) were significantly higher in OFA group than that in OBA group. Incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was lower in OFA group. Consistently, fewer patients in OFA group consumed atropine (8% vs. 32%, P = 0.019) and ephedrine (5% vs. 38%, P = 0.001) compared to OBA group. Furthermore, patients in OFA group had a longer awakening time (7.14 ± 2.63 min vs. 4.54 ± 1.14 min, P = 0.000) and recovery time of orientation (11.76 ± 3.15 min vs. 6.92 ± 1.19 min, P = 0.000). Fewer patients in the OFA group experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (11% vs. 51%, P = 0.000) and consumed ondansetron (5% vs. 35%, P = 0.003) compared to OBA group. And patients in OFA group had a higher satisfaction score than those in OBA group (9 (8 - 9) vs. 7 (7 - 8), P = 0.000). For patients undergoing lumpectomy, OFA technique with dexmedetomidine-esketamine-lidocaine showed a better postoperative analgesic efficacy, a more stable hemodynamics, and a lower incidence of PONV. However, such advantage of OFA technique should be weighed against a longer awakening time and recovery time of orientation in clinical practice.","Qian Xia Li, Li Ping, Chen Ya Jie, Xu Shi Qin, Wang Xian, Feng Shan Wu",Journal of clinical medicine research,2023,37822850,PMC10563822,10.14740/jocmr5000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37822850,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10563822,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A survey of United States obstetric anesthesiologists' perceived value of obstetric anesthesiology fellowship.,"Subspecialty training in obstetric anesthesiology is associated with improved patient outcomes and reduced anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this, the demand for fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologists far exceeds the supply. This survey study aimed to evaluate the perceived value of obstetric anesthesiology subspecialty training on career trajectory, job satisfaction, quality of life, and job autonomy. After Institutional Review Board approval, we conducted a cross-sectional study of fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologists in the United States of America. In March and April 2022, program directors of obstetric anesthesiology fellowships distributed an electronic survey link containing 29 multiple-choice questions to their program alumni. Survey content included respondent demographic characteristics, practice models, career information, and perceived value of an obstetric anesthesiology fellowship. We surveyed 217/502 (43%) fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologists with a response rate of 158/217 (73%). Most worked in urban, academic, and level IV perinatal health centers. The majority believed an obstetric anesthesiology fellowship was ""extremely beneficial"" (77%), enhanced quality of life (84%), improved the quality of patient care (99%), and was influential in helping obtain their first post-training job (86%). The perceived value of the fellowship included an enhanced career trajectory, a sense of purpose, improved job satisfaction, a sense of work community, lower burnout, involvement in maternal health initiatives, increased mentorship, and departmental leadership. In this survey study, fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologists perceived a positive impact of fellowship training on career trajectory, job protection and autonomy, quality of life, and job satisfaction. This information may be meaningful to trainees considering pursuing a fellowship and a career in obstetric anesthesiology.","Thomas C, Neumann K E, Smith C, Dominguez J E, Traynor A, Farber M K, Zakowski M, McCarthy R J, Peralta F M",International journal of obstetric anesthesia,2023,37804553,,10.1016/j.ijoa.2023.103930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37804553,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,Obstetric anesthesiology subspecialty fellowship training,Fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologists in the United States of America,"Enhanced career trajectory, improved job satisfaction, quality of life, job autonomy, sense of purpose, sense of work community, lower burnout, involvement in maternal health initiatives, increased mentorship, and departmental leadership"
The neurometabolic axis: A novel therapeutic target in heart failure.,"Abnormal cardiac metabolism or cardiac metabolic remodeling is reported before the onset of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is known to trigger and maintain the mechanical dysfunction and electrical, and structural abnormalities of the ventricle. A dysregulated cardiac autonomic tone characterized by sympathetic overdrive with blunted parasympathetic activation is another pathophysiological hallmark of HF. Emerging evidence suggests a link between autonomic nervous system activity and cardiac metabolism. Chronic β-adrenergic activation promotes maladaptive metabolic remodeling whereas cholinergic activation attenuates the metabolic aberrations through favorable modulation of key metabolic regulatory molecules. Restoration of sympathovagal balance by neuromodulation strategies is emerging as a novel nonpharmacological treatment strategy in HF. The current review attempts to evaluate the 'neuro-metabolic axis' in HFrEF and whether neuromodulation can mitigate the adverse metabolic remodeling in HFrEF.","Chakraborty Praloy, Po Sunny S, Scherlag Benjamin J, Dasari Tarun W",Life sciences,2023,37774940,,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122122,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37774940,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Development of a Brief Cognitive Screening Tool for Predicting Postoperative Delirium in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Secondary Analysis.,"A simple, rapid, and effective cognitive screening test appropriate for fast-paced settings with limited resources and staff is essential, especially preoperatively. This study aimed to develop and validate the short versions of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for predicting postoperative delirium (POD) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were scheduled for surgery. The current study was a secondary analysis of data collected from 128 inpatients scheduled for deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nuclei (STN-DBS) lasting >60 min, at Tsinghua University Yuquan Hospital, China. Preoperative cognitive screening was performed during the preoperative visit using the MMSE and MoCA. The optimal MMSE and MoCA cut-off scores for detecting PD-MCI was 27 and 23 respectively. The POD was assessed twice a day on the first postoperative day until discharge by the confusion assessment method. The backward conditional logistic regression analysis was used to organize the reduced versions of the MMSE or MoCA. Also, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were examined using the DeLong test. 125/128 PD patients were included in the analysis, and 27 (21.6%) developed POD. The MMSE reduced version (orientation to time, attention and calculation, and comprehension) demonstrated performance similar to the original MMSE in predicting POD (<i>z</i>=0.820, <i>p</i>=0.412). The AUC of the original MoCA and the short MoCA (visuospatial and executive attention and orientation) were 0.808 and 0.826, respectively. There was no significantly difference in the AUC values between the tests (<i>z</i>=0.561, <i>p</i>=0.575). Our simplified MMSE and MoCA could be efficiently used to identify patients at risk for POD. Also, short cognitive tests could be considered while predicting POD in fast-paced preoperative settings with limited resources and staff.","Zhou Yongde, Wang Xiaoxiao, Li Zhengqian, Ma Yu, Yu Cuiping, Chen Yao, Ding Jian, Yu Jianfeng, Zhou Rongsong, Yang Ning, Liu Taotao, Guo Xiangyang, Fan Ting, Shi Chengmei",Clinical interventions in aging,2023,37727451,PMC10506594,10.2147/CIA.S410687,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37727451,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10506594,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Longitudinal versus circumferential biomechanical behavior of the aneurysmal ascending aorta.,"We evaluate the independent effects of patient and aortic tissue characteristics on biaxial physiologic mechanical metrics in aneurysmal and nonaneurysmal tissues, and uniaxial failure metrics in aneurysmal tissue, comparing longitudinal and circumferential behavior. From February 2017 to October 2022, 382 aortic specimens were collected from 134 patients; 268 specimens underwent biaxial testing, and 114 specimens underwent uniaxial testing. Biaxial testing evaluated Green-Lagrange transition strain and low and high tangent moduli. Uniaxial testing evaluated failure stretch, Cauchy stress, and low and high tangent moduli. Longitudinal gradient boosting models were implemented to estimate mechanical metrics and covariates of importance. On biaxial testing, nonaneurysmal tissue was less deformable and exhibited a lower transition strain than aneurysmal tissue in the longitudinal (0.18 vs 0.30, P < .001) and circumferential (0.25 vs 0.30, P = .01) directions. Older age and increasing ascending aortic length contributed most to predicting transition strain. On uniaxial testing, longitudinal specimens failed at lower stretch (1.4 vs 1.5, P = .003) and Cauchy stress (1.0 vs 1.9 kPa, P < .001) than circumferential specimens. Failure stretch and Cauchy stress were most strongly associated with tissue orientation and decreased sharply with older age. Age, ascending aortic length, and tissue thickness were the most frequent covariates predicting mechanical metrics across 10 prediction models. Age was the strongest predictor of mechanical behavior. After adjusting for age, nonaneurysmal tissue was less deformable than aneurysmal tissue. Differences in longitudinal and circumferential mechanics contribute to tissue dysfunction and failure in ascending aneurysms. This highlights the need to better understand the effects of age, ascending aortic length, and thickness on clinical aortic behavior.","Kramer Benjamin, Thompson Matthew A, Tarraf Samar A, Vianna Emily, Gillespie Callan, Germano Emidio, Gentle Brett, Cikach Frank, Lowry Ashley M, Pande Amol, Blackstone Eugene, Hargrave Jennifer, Colbrunn Robb, Bellini Chiara, Roselli Eric E",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2024,37716653,,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2023.09.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37716653,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

"Pro-Con Debate: Consideration of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender Is Detrimental to Successful Mentorship.","Anesthesiology remains a specialty with low representation of women or members of racial and ethnic groups considered underrepresented in medicine (UiM). In the United States, women account for 33% of anesthesiology residents, while physicians identifying as Black, African American, Latinx, American Indian, or Alaska Native account for approximately 10%. Underrepresentation of these groups is even more pronounced in academic anesthesiology, especially at the senior ranks and roles, such as department chairs. Leaders in the field have recently shared recommendations for how individual departments, medical schools, hospitals, and professional organizations can create and support a more diverse anesthesiology workforce. These commentaries have often stressed the importance of mentorship for supporting women and physicians from UiM groups, including mentorship of trainees and practicing anesthesiologists seeking to advance their careers. While the value of mentorship is undisputed, it remains a matter of controversy whether race, ethnicity, or gender should be explicitly considered by mentoring programs and individual mentors.

Followership in interprofessional healthcare teams: a state-of-the-art narrative review.,"A state-of-the-art (SotA) literature review-a type of narrative review- was conducted to answer: What historical developments led to current conceptualisations of followership in interprofessional healthcare teams (IHTs)? Working from a constructivist orientation, SotA literature reviews generate a chronological overview of how knowledge evolved and presents this summary in three parts: (1) this is where we are now, (2) this is how we got here and (3) this is where we should go next. Using the SotA six-stage methodology, a total of 48 articles focused on followership in IHTs were used in this study. Articles about followership within IHTs first appeared in 1993. Until 2011, followership was framed as leader-centric; leaders used their position to influence followers to uphold their dictums. This perspective was challenged when scholars outside of healthcare emphasised the importance of team members for achieving goals, rejecting a myopic focus on physicians as leaders. Today, followership is an important focus of IHT research but two contradictory views are present: (1) followers are described as active team members in IHTs where shared leadership models prevail and (2) conceptually and practically, old ways of thinking about followership (ie, followers are passive team members) still occur. This incongruity has generated a variable set of qualities associated with good followership. Leadership and followership are closely linked concepts. For leaders and followers in today's IHTs to flourish, the focus must be on followers being active members of the team instead of passive members. Since theories are increasingly encouraging distributed leadership, shared leadership and/or situational leadership, then we must understand the followership work that all team members need to harness. We need to be cognizant of team dynamics that work within different contexts and use leadership and followership conceptualisations that are congruent with those contexts.","Barry Erin S, Teunissen Pim, Varpio Lara",BMJ leader,2024,37696538,PMC12038140,10.1136/leader-2023-000773,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37696538,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12038140,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Academic anaesthesiology: a global perspective on training, support, and future development of early career researchers.","As anaesthesiologists face increasing clinical demands and a limited and competitive funding environment for academic work, the sustainability of academic anaesthesiologists has never been more tenuous. Yet, the speciality needs academic anaesthesiologists in many roles, extending beyond routine clinical duties. Anaesthesiologist educators, researchers, and administrators are required not only to train future generations but also to lead innovation and expansion of anaesthesiology and related specialities, all to improve patient care. This group of early career researchers with geographically distinct training and practice backgrounds aim to highlight the diversity in clinical and academic training and career development pathways for anaesthesiologists globally. Although multiple routes to success exist, one common thread is the need for consistent support of strong mentors and sponsors. Moreover, to address inequitable opportunities, we emphasise the need for diversity and inclusivity through global collaboration and exchange that aims to improve access to research training and participation.

"Research capacity, motivators and barriers to conducting research among healthcare providers in Tanzania's public health system: a mixed methods study.","Building health research capacity in low- and middle-income countries is essential to achieving universal access to safe, high-quality healthcare. It can enable healthcare workers to conduct locally relevant research and apply findings to strengthen their health delivery systems. However, lack of funding, experience, know-how, and weak research infrastructures hinders their ability. Understanding research capacity, engagement, and contextual factors that either promote or obstruct research efforts by healthcare workers can inform national strategies aimed at building research capacity. We used a convergent mixed-methods study design to understand research capacity and research engagement of healthcare workers in Tanzania's public health system, including the barriers, motivators, and facilitators to conducting research. Our sample included 462 randomly selected healthcare workers from 45 facilities. We conducted surveys and interviews to capture data in five categories: (1) healthcare workers research capacity; (2) research engagement; (3) barriers, motivators, and facilitators; (4) interest in conducting research; and (5) institutional research capacity. We assessed quantitative and qualitative data using frequency and thematic analysis, respectively; we merged the data to identify recurring and unifying concepts. Respondents reported low experience and confidence in quantitative (34% and 28.7%, respectively) and qualitative research methods (34.5% and 19.6%, respectively). Less than half (44%) of healthcare workers engaged in research. Engagement in research was positively associated with: working at a District Hospital or above (p = 0.006), having a university degree or more (p = 0.007), and previous research experience (p = 0.001); it was negatively associated with female sex (p = 0.033). Barriers to conducting research included lack of research funding, time, skills, opportunities to practice, and research infrastructure. Motivators and facilitators included a desire to address health problems, professional development, and local and international collaborations. Almost all healthcare workers (92%) indicated interest in building their research capacity. Individual and institutional research capacity and engagement among healthcare workers in Tanzania is low, despite high interest for capacity building. We propose a fourfold pathway for building research capacity in Tanzania through (1) high-quality research training and mentorship; (2) strengthening research infrastructure, funding, and coordination; (3) implementing policies and strategies that stimulate engagement; and (4) strengthening local and international collaborations.","Kengia James T, Kalolo Albino, Barash David, Chwa Cindy, Hayirli Tuna Cem, Kapologwe Ntuli A, Kinyaga Ally, Meara John G, Staffa Steven J, Zanial Noor, Alidina Shehnaz",Human resources for health,2023,37670321,PMC10478476,10.1186/s12960-023-00858-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37670321,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10478476,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Protein kinase A: A potential marker of sympathovagal imbalance in heart failure.,"Mitigation of cardiac autonomic dysregulation by neuromodulation technologies is emerging as a new therapeutic modality of heart failure (HF). This recent progress has necessitated the identification of a biomarker for the quantification of sympathovagal balance, the potential target of 'neuromodulation' strategies. The currently available autonomic nervous system assessment parameters do not truly reflect the sympathovagal balance of the ventricle. Protein kinase A (PKA) is an intracellular enzyme that plays a major role in the pathophysiology of functional and structural ventricular remodeling in HF. Interestingly, sympathetic and parasympathetic activations exert reciprocal influence on the activity of PKA. The current review attempts to evaluate the potential concept and feasibility of using in vitro assessment of PKA activity as a marker of sympathovagal balance in HF.","Chakraborty Praloy, Po Sunny S, Yabluchanskiy Andriy, Dasari Tarun W",Life sciences,2023,37666387,,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37666387,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Tracheostomy versus prolonged intubation in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: a multicentre retrospective cohort study.,"Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that is commonly performed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). It is frequently required in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), a subset of patients with prolonged altered state of consciousness that may require a long period of mechanical respiratory assistance. While many clinicians favour the use of early tracheostomy in TBI patients, the evidence in favour of this practice remains scarce. The aims of our study were to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of tracheostomy versus prolonged endotracheal intubation, as well as whether the timing of the procedure may influence outcome in patients with moderate to severe TBI. We conducted a retrospective multicentre cohort study based on data from the provincial integrated trauma system of Quebec (Québec Trauma Registry). The study population was selected from adult trauma patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2019. We included patients 16 yr and older with moderate to severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 13) who required mechanical ventilation for 96 hr or longer. Our primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital and ICU mortality, six-month mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, ICU and hospital length of stay as well as orientation of patients upon discharge from the hospital. We used propensity score covariate adjustment. To overcome the effect of immortal time bias, an extended Cox shared frailty model was used to compare mortality between groups. From 2013 to 2019, 26,923 patients with TBI were registered in the Québec Trauma Registry. A total of 983 patients who required prolonged endotracheal intubation for 96 hr or more were included in the study, 374 of whom underwent a tracheostomy and 609 of whom remained intubated. We observed a reduction in 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.53) associated with tracheostomy compared with prolonged endotracheal intubation. This effect was also seen in the ICU as well as at six months. Tracheostomy, when compared with prolonged endotracheal intubation, was associated with an increase in the duration of mechanical respiratory assistance without any increase in the length of stay. No effect on mortality was observed when comparing early vs late tracheostomy procedures. An early procedure was associated with a reduction in the duration of mechanical respiratory support as well as hospital and ICU length of stay. In this multicentre cohort study, tracheostomy was associated with decreased mortality when compared with prolonged endotracheal intubation in patients with moderate to severe TBI. This effect does not appear to be modified by the timing of the procedure. Nevertheless, the generalization and application of these results remains limited by potential residual time-dependent indication bias.","Villemure-Poliquin Noémie, Costerousse Olivier, Lessard Bonaventure Paule, Audet Nathalie, Lauzier François, Moore Lynne, Zarychanski Ryan, Turgeon Alexis F",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2023,37505417,PMC10447593,10.1007/s12630-023-02539-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37505417,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10447593,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Accuracy Evaluation Trial of Mixed Reality-Guided Spinal Puncture Technology.,"To evaluate the accuracy of mixed reality (MR)-guided visualization technology for spinal puncture (MRsp). MRsp involved the following three steps: 1. Lumbar spine computed tomography (CT) data were obtained to reconstruct virtual 3D images, which were imported into a HoloLens (2nd gen). 2. The patented MR system quickly recognized the spatial orientation and superimposed the virtual image over the real spine in the HoloLens. 3. The operator performed the spinal puncture with structural information provided by the virtual image. A posture fixation cushion was used to keep the subjects' lateral decubitus position consistent. 12 subjects were recruited to verify the setup error and the registration error. The setup error was calculated using the first two CT scans and measuring the displacement of two location markers. The projection points of the upper edge of the L3 spinous process (L3↑), the lower edge of the L3 spinous process (L3↓), and the lower edge of the L4 spinous process (L4↓) in the virtual image were positioned and marked on the skin as the registration markers. A third CT scan was performed to determine the registration error by measuring the displacement between the three registration markers and the corresponding real spinous process edges. The setup errors in the position of the cranial location marker between CT scans along the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) axes of the CT bed measured 0.09 ± 0.06 cm, 0.30 ± 0.28 cm, and 0.22 ± 0.12 cm, respectively, while those of the position of the caudal location marker measured 0.08 ± 0.06 cm, 0.29 ± 0.18 cm, and 0.18 ± 0.10 cm, respectively. The registration errors between the three registration markers and the subject's real L3↑, L3↓, and L4↓ were 0.11 ± 0.09 cm, 0.15 ± 0.13 cm, and 0.13 ± 0.10 cm, respectively, in the SI direction. This MR-guided visualization technology for spinal puncture can accurately and quickly superimpose the reconstructed 3D CT images over a real human spine.","Wu Jiajun, Gao Lei, Shi Qiao, Qin Chunhui, Xu Kai, Jiang Zhaoshun, Zhang Xixue, Li Ming, Qiu Jianjian, Gu Weidong",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,2023,37484696,PMC10361284,10.2147/TCRM.S416918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37484696,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10361284,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Comparison of remimazolam-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Remimazolam is a novel benzodiazepine with fast onset and short half-life. We compared the effects of remimazolam and propofol on recovery profiles for general anesthesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We randomly assigned 108 patients to either a remimazolam (n=54) or propofol (n=54) group. Remimazolam and propofol were used for induction and maintanance of anesthesia. Following anesthesia, we recorded the time until an Aldrete score of 9 was achieved as the primary surrogate marker of complete recovery. The time to reach a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score of 2 and the time from the end of anesthesia to eye opening time, recovery time of orientation, time to spontaneous breathing, extubation time, and the time required for analgesics were measured. Heart rate, blood pressure, and bispectral index were assessed before, during, and after pneumoperitoneum. We included 101 patients in the analysis. In the remimazolam group, it took longer to reach an Aldrete score of 9 after the drug infusion ended (P = 0.031). There was no difference in the time to reach MOAA/S 2 between the two groups. The time to eye opening, recovery time of orientation, and time required for analgesics were longer and heart rate was higher in the remimazolam group. Neither blood pressure, nor extubation time differed between groups. Remimazolam and propofol provided safe induction and maintenance of anesthesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The recovery time from anesthesia was longer than that with propofol. Fewer hemodynamic changes were observed with remimazolam, but further studies are needed.","Lee Tae Young, Kim Min A, Eom Deuk Won, Jung Ji Wook, Chung Chan Jong, Park Sang Yoong",Anesthesia and pain medicine,2023,37468208,PMC10410549,10.17085/apm.22252,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37468208,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410549,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Case series of tracheal extubation in prone position after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography general anesthesia.,"The study aims to present a 15-patient case series of tracheal extubation in the prone position after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) general anesthesia. Fifteen inpatients who underwent elective ERCP in our hospital were prospectively enrolled, and a series of case studies were conducted with the prone extubation technique after general anesthesia. All patients underwent routine operation of tracheal intubation under general anesthesia. After the surgery, when the train-of-four ratio (TOFr) ≥0.9, bispectral index (BIS) ≥80, tidal volume ≥6 ml/kg and the required actions could be performed, the endotracheal catheter was removed after sufficient negative pressure suction of oral secretions. After the endotracheal catheter was removed, the patient autonomously turned to the transport bed with the assistance of medical staff and was then admitted to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further observation. When the patient awoke, he had regained orientation, and presented stable vital signs, no nausea and vomiting, and no other discomfort symptoms, he/she was able to leave PACU and returned to the ward with a Steward score of ≥5. All 15 patients who underwent ERCP elective surgery were successfully extubated in the prone position after surgery. Transient hypoxemia with SpO2 below 90% occurred in 2 of the 15 patients and returned to normal with oxygen mask administration. 7 patients had coughs and were without special treatment. Another 1 patient showed transient abnormal hemodynamic fluctuations after extubation, mean airway pressure (MAP) was higher than 20% of the baseline value, and hemodynamics was stable after drug treatment. The prone extubation technique is feasible for ERCP general anesthesia patients. However, a larger sample size is needed to validate its safety and to verify whether there exist advantages of the extubation technique in a prone position over a supine position.","Xiang J-H, Wei P, Yuan W, Ruan W-Q, Li X, Song J-G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2023,37458659,,10.26355/eurrev_202307_32964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37458659,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Commissural and coronary alignment of the Venus-A valve after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a retrospective cross-sectional study.,"Previous studies have shown that neo-commissural orientation of transcatheter heart valve (THV) can influence coronary obstruction during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), long-term durability of THV, and coronary artery access for reintervention after TAVR. Specific initial orientations of Evolut R/Pro and Acurate Neo aortic valves can improve commissural alignment. However, the method of achieving commissural alignment with the Venus-A valve remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the extent of commissural and coronary alignment of the Venus-A self-expanding valve after TAVR using a standard system delivery technique. A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed. At the time of enrollment, patients who underwent pre- and post-procedural electrocardiographically-gated contrast-enhanced CT with a second-generation 64-row multidetector scanner were selected for the study. Commissural alignment was categorized as aligned (0-15° angle deviation), mild (15-30°), moderate (30-45°), or severe (45-60°) commissural misalignment (CMA). Coronary alignment was categorized as having no coronary overlap (CO) (>35°), moderate CO (20-35°), or severe CO (≤20°). The results were represented as proportions to assess the extent of commissural and coronary alignment. Forty-five TAVR patients were ultimately included in the analysis. THVs were shown to be randomly implanted: 20.0% of THVs were aligned, 33.3% had mild CMA, 26.7% had moderate CMA, and 20.0% had severe CMA. The incidence of severe CO was 24.4% with the left main coronary artery, 28.9% with the right coronary artery, 6.7% with both coronary arteries, and 46.7% with one or both coronary arteries. The results showed that commissural or coronary alignment could not be achieved with the Venus-A valve using a standard system delivery technique. Therefore, specific methods to attain alignment with the Venus-A valve need to be identified.","Xi Siyu, Zhang Haishan, Gao Yuan, Chen Xin, Tan Wenfei, Guo Liang, Sun Yingxian",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,2023,37405016,PMC10315423,10.21037/cdt-22-565,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37405016,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10315423,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
No Miracles in Two Minutes: A Randomized Controlled Study on the Impact of Preparatory Expansive Posing on Anesthesiology Residents' Performance in Mock Structured Oral Examinations.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of engaging in preparatory expansive posing on the performance of anesthesiology trainees during a mock structured oral examination. A total of 38 clinical residents at a single institution participated in this prospective randomized controlled study. Participants were stratified by clinical anesthesia year and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 orientation rooms to prepare for the examination. The preparatory expansive posing participants stood for 2 minutes with their hands and arms above their heads and with their feet approximately 1 ft apart. Conversely, the control participants sat quietly in a chair for 2 minutes. All participants then received the same orientation and examination. Faculty evaluation of resident performance, residents' self-assessment of performance, and anxiety score were collected. There was no evidence to support our primary hypothesis that residents who engaged in preparatory expansive posing for 2 minutes prior to a mock structured oral examination would score higher than their control counterparts (<i>P</i> = .68). There was no evidence to support our secondary hypotheses that preparatory expansive posing increases self-assessment of one's performance (<i>P</i> = .31) or reduces perceived anxiety during a mock structured oral examination (<i>P</i> = .85). Preparatory expansive posing did not improve anesthesiology residents' mock structured oral examination performance or self-assessment of their performance, nor did it reduce their perceived anxiety. Preparatory expansive posing is likely not a useful technique in improving the performance of residents in structured oral examinations.","Chen Fei, Stiegler Marjorie, Martinelli Susan M, Arora Harendra, Isaak Robert S",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2023,37377508,PMC10291955,10.46374/volxxv_issue2_Chen,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37377508,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10291955,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Procedure for Mouse Dorsal Root Ganglion Cryosectioning.,"High-quality mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cryostat sections are crucial for proper immunochemistry staining and RNAscope studies in the research of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, itch, as well as other peripheral neurological conditions. However, it remains a challenge to consistently obtain high-quality, intact, and flat cryostat sections onto glass slides because of the tiny sample size of the DRG tissue. So far, there is no article describing an optimal protocol for DRG cryosectioning. This protocol presents a step-by-step method to resolve the frequently encountered difficulties associated with DRG cryosectioning. The presented article explains how to remove the surrounding liquid from the DRG tissue samples, place the DRG sections on the slide facing the same orientation, and flatten the sections on the glass slide without curving up. Although this protocol has been developed for cryosectioning the DRG samples, it can be applied for the cryosectioning of many other tissues with a small sample size.","He Liangliang, Zhao Wenxing, Zhang Lingyi, Ilango Maalveka, Zhao Na, Yang Liqiang, Guan Zhonghui",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2023,37358286,,10.3791/65232,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37358286,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

In recent years, discrimination based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, other demographic factors, and the intersection of these identities have gained greater attention not only in our society at large but also within medicine and anesthesiology. The stark consequences of this discrimination for both anesthesiologists and patients from equity-seeking groups have become clearer in recent years, although the full scope of the problem is not fully understood. Data regarding the demographics of the national anesthesia workforce are lacking. Literature describing patient perspectives of various equity-seeking groups is also sparse, although increasing. Health disparities impacting people who are racialized, women, LGBTQIA+, and/or living with disability are also present in the perioperative context.

Factors affecting duration of inability to work after intramedullary stabilization of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures.,"Duration of inability to work (DIW) after displaced midshaft clavicular fractures (DMCF) is an important clinical and socioeconomic treatment outcome. However, evidence on DIW after DMCF intramedullary stabilization (IMS) is still limited. We aimed to examine DIW and to identify medical and socioeconomic predictors with direct or indirect impact on DIW after IMS of DMCF. Socioeconomic predictors can explain the unique proportion of the DIW variance after IMS of DMCF above the variance explained by medical predictors. Using a retrospective cohort unicentric design we included patients surgically treated with IMS after DMCF from 2009-2022 with employment status subject to compulsory social security contributions, and without major postoperative complications, in one level 2 trauma center in Germany. In total, we tested the impact of 17 different medical (i.e., smoking, body mass index [BMI], operative duration, etc.) and socioeconomic predictors (i.e., health insurance type, physical workload, etc.) on DIW. Statistics included multiple regression and path analyses. A total of 166 patients met eligibility criteria, with DIW 35.1±31.1days. Operative duration, physical workload, and physical therapy prolonged DIW (p<0.001). In contrast, enrollment in private health insurance reduced DIW (p<0.05). Furthermore, the effect of BMI and fracture complexity on DIW was fully mediated by operative duration. The model explained 43% of the DIW variance. Socioeconomic factors were found to directly predict DIW, even after controlling for medical predictors, which confirmed our research question. This is in line with previous findings and highlights the relevance of socioeconomic predictors in this context. We believe that the proposed model can serve surgeons and patients as an orientation guide to estimate DIW after IMS of DMCF.

Veiled Harm: Impacts of Microaggressions on Psychological Safety and Physician Burnout.,"Microaggression is widespread in the health care industry and occurs in every health care delivery setting. It comes in many forms, from subtle to obvious, unconscious to conscious, and verbal to behavioral. Women and minority groups (eg, race/ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation) are often marginalized during medical training and subsequent clinical practice. These contribute to the development of psychologically unsafe working environments and widespread physician burnout. Physicians experiencing burnout who work in unsafe psychological environments impact the safety and quality of patient care. In turn, these conditions impose high costs on the health care system and organizations. Microaggressions and psychological unsafe work environments are intricately related and mutually enhanced. Therefore, addressing both simultaneously is a good business practice and a responsibility for any health care organization. Additionally, addressing them can reduce physician burnout, decrease physician turnover, and improve the quality of patient care.

Cannabis Use and Sharing Practices Among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Individuals During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Cannabis behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among sexual minority (SM) individuals in the United States remain understudied. This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of cannabis use and cannabis sharing, a potential risk for COVID-19 transmission, among SM and heterosexual-identified individuals in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This cross-sectional study used data from an anonymous, US-based web survey on cannabis-related behaviors from August to September 2020. Included participants reported past-year nonmedical cannabis use. Associations between frequency of cannabis use and sharing behaviors by sexual orientation were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall, 1112 respondents reported past-year cannabis use; mean age 33 years (standard deviation = 9.4), 66% male identified (<i>n</i> = 723), and 31% SM identified adults (<i>n</i> = 340). Increased cannabis use during the pandemic was similar among SM (24.7%; <i>n</i> = 84) and heterosexual (24.9%; <i>n</i> = 187) respondents. Any sharing during the pandemic was 81% for SM adults (<i>n</i> = 237) and 73% for heterosexual adults (<i>n</i> = 486). In the fully adjusted models, the odds of daily/weekly cannabis use and the odds of any cannabis sharing among SM respondents were 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42-0.74) and 1.60 (95% CI = 1.13-2.26), respectively, compared with heterosexual respondents. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> SM respondents were less likely to use cannabis with high frequency during the pandemic but more likely to share cannabis compared with heterosexual respondents. Sharing cannabis was high overall, which may increase COVID-19 risk. Public health messaging around sharing may be important during COVID-19 surges and respiratory pandemics especially as cannabis becomes more widely available in the United States.","Assaf Ryan D, Javanbakht Marjan, Gorbach Pamina M, Cooper Ziva D",LGBT health,2023,37252794,PMC10552144,10.1089/lgbt.2022.0236,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37252794,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10552144,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Dexmedetomidine-Oxycodone combination for conscious sedation during colonoscopy in obese patients: A randomized controlled trial.,"Obesity is a risk factor for sedation-related respiratory depression during colonoscopy. In a colonoscopy, propofol is frequently used because of its strong sedative and hypnotic properties. However, propofol is associated with marked respiratory depression. The objective of this trial was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine plus oxycodone for conscious sedation during colonoscopy in obese patients. A total of 120 patients had colonoscopies, and they were divided into two groups at random: Dexmedetomidine and oxycodone were used to sedate group Dex + oxy; while group Pro + oxy received anesthesia with propofol plus oxycodone. Parameters including blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, blood oxygen saturation, injection pain, and recovery time were recorded for both groups. The incidence of hypoxemia was significantly reduced in group Dex + oxy compared with group Pro + oxy (4.9% <i>vs</i> 20.3%, P = 0.011). Blood pressure was lower, and heart rate was higher in group Pro + oxy compared with group Dex + oxy (P < 0.05). In addition, group Dex + oxy showed a significantly shorter caecal insertion time, recovery time to orientation, and recovery time to walking than group Pro + oxy (P < 0.05). Endoscopist satisfaction scores were significantly higher in group Dex + oxy compared with group Pro + oxy (P = 0.042). For obese patients, dexmedetomidine plus oxycodone effectively sedate them with few adverse effects, while also reducing colonoscopy operation difficulty by allowing obese patients to reposition. Thus, dexmedetomidine plus oxycodone could be used safely as a conscious sedation method for colonoscopy in obese patients. The protocol was registered at www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR1800017283, July 21, 2018).","Wang Xinran, Zhang Manman, Sun Han, Zhang Rui, Zhu Yangzi, Zhang Zhen, Shi Rongxia",Heliyon,2023,37251861,PMC10209023,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16370,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37251861,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10209023,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Engineering a conduction-consistent cardiac patch with graphene oxide modified butterfly wings and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.,"Engineering a conduction-consistent cardiac patch has direct implications to biomedical research. However, there is difficulty in obtaining and maintaining a system that allows researchers to study physiologically relevant cardiac development, maturation, and drug screening due to the issues around inconsistent contractions of cardiomyocytes. Butterfly wings have special nanostructures arranged in parallel, which could help generate the alignment of cardiomyocytes to better mimic the natural heart tissue structure. Here, we construct a conduction-consistent human cardiac muscle patch by assembling human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) on graphene oxide (GO) modified butterfly wings. We also show this system functions as a versatile model to study human cardiomyogenesis by assembling human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hiPSC-CPCs) on the GO modified butterfly wings. The GO modified butterfly wing platform facilitated the parallel orientation of hiPSC-CMs, enhanced relative maturation as well as improved conduction consistency of the cardiomyocytes. In addition, GO modified butterfly wings enhanced the proliferation and maturation characteristics of the hiPSC-CPCs. In accordance with data obtained from RNA-sequencing and gene signatures, assembling hiPSC-CPCs on GO modified butterfly wings stimulated the differentiation of the progenitors into relatively mature hiPSC-CMs. These characteristics and capabilities of GO modified butterfly wings make them an ideal platform for heart research and drug screening.","Tan Yao, Lu Tingting, Chen Ying, Witman Nevin, Yan Bingqian, Yang Li, Liu Minglu, Gong Yiqi, Ai Xuefeng, Luo Runjiao, Wang Huijing, Wang Wei, Fu Wei",Bioengineering & translational medicine,2023,37206241,PMC10189447,10.1002/btm2.10522,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37206241,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10189447,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Misconceptions about women in leadership in academic medicine.,"Despite progress made over the past decade, women are under-represented in positions of leadership in academic medicine. Women physicians face numerous challenges throughout their careers. Despite achieving leadership positions, women in leadership continue to experience the impact of those challenges. In this review, we describe four misconceptions about women in leadership, along with their impact and recommendations. First, we describe differences between mentorship and sponsorship, as well as their impact on attaining leadership positions. Second, the gender pay gap persists throughout women's careers, regardless of leadership positions. Third, we explore the role of self-efficacy in leadership in the context of stereotype threats. Fourth, gendered expectations of leadership characteristics place an undue burden on women, detracting from their leadership effectiveness. Organizations can address the challenges women face by creating robust mentorship and sponsorship networks, establishing transparent and equitable pay policies, promoting and normalizing a broader range of leadership styles, and improving work flexibility and support structure. Ultimately, such changes serve all members of the organization through increased retention and engagement.","Hastie Maya J, Lee Allison, Siddiqui Shahla, Oakes Daryl, Wong Cynthia A",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2023,37193865,PMC10188227,10.1007/s12630-023-02458-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37193865,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10188227,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
After the Knife: A Detailed Roadmap for Vestibular Schwannoma Resection in the Semi-Sitting Position - How I do it.,"Vestibular schwannoma surgery remains a neurosurgical challenge, with known risks, dependent on a number of factors, from patient selection to surgical experience of the team. The semi-sitting position has gained popularity as an alternative to the traditional supine position for vestibular schwannoma resection due to potential advantages such as improved surgical exposure due to clearer surgical field and anatomical orientation. However, there is a lack of standardized protocols for performing the procedure in the semi-sitting position, leading to variations in surgical techniques and outcomes. In this study, we aimed to establish a standardized approach for vestibular schwannoma resection using the semi-sitting position. Initiating after final position for semi-sitting, the authors have divided the surgical steps into five major parts for improved understanding and replication. Surgical techniques were analyzed through one hundred steps to identify commonalities, determining the optimal procedural steps for the semi-sitting position using surgical video for visual conceptualization. The analysis described one hundred steps for vestibular schwannoma resection in the semi-sitting position, with visual demonstration of the various parts of the procedure through surgical videos. Specific recommendations for each step were outlined, including appropriate approach, monitoring strategies, and tumor and posterior fossa structures manipulation. Five major parts of the procedure were identified, leading to a reproducible standardization of the surgical procedure of vestibular schwannoma resection in the semi-sitting position. This study provides a comprehensive standardized protocol for the semi-sitting procedure in vestibular schwannoma resection. By establishing a consistent approach, surgeons can minimize variations in surgical techniques and improve patient outcomes. The identified steps and recommendations can serve as a valuable resource for surgical teams involved in vestibular schwannoma resection and facilitate the dissemination and reproducibility of best practices.","Roman Alex, Tufegdzic Boris, Pinto Vania, Lamperti Massimo, Elhammady Mohammed, Roser Florian",World neurosurgery,2023,37169076,,10.1016/j.wneu.2023.05.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37169076,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Efficacy and Safety of a Subanesthetic Dose of Esketamine Combined with Propofol in Patients with Obesity Undergoing Painless Gastroscopy: A Prospective, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.","Patients with obesity are more susceptible to hypoxemia. Anesthetic management for patients with obesity undergoing painless gastroscopy presents a severe challenge for anesthesiologists. Esketamine is a NMDA antagonist that has been proven to be beneficial for ameliorating respiratory depression owing to its sympathomimetic effect; however, there are no relevant reports on its use in patients with obesity. We designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether esketamine can be the ideal adjuvant to propofol sedation in patients with obesity undergoing painless gastroscopy. A total of 104 patients with obesity undergoing painless gastroscopy were randomly divided into group C (propofol+saline) and group S (propofol+esketamine 0.25 mg/kg). Anesthesia was induced by 2 mg/kg propofol with saline or esketamine. The consumption of propofol, hemodynamic parameters, duration of procedure, induction time, postoperative awakening time, and orientation recovery time were recorded. Adverse events and satisfaction scores were also recorded. Propofol consumption was 274.4±22.6 mg and 201.3±16.6 mg in groups C and S, respectively. The induction time of groups C and S were 25.4±2.3 s and 17.8±1.9 s, respectively. The postoperative awakening times of groups C and S were 6.2±1.1 min and 4.8±1.3 min, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters were more stable in group S than in group C. The incidence of adverse events such as injection pain, hypoxemia, hypotension, bradycardia, choking, and body movement were significantly lower in group S. The satisfaction scores of the endoscopist and anesthesiologist were (4.58±0.49 vs 3.71±0.83) and (4.75±0.44 vs 3.33±0.92), respectively. The combination of propofol and esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) improves the safety and reduces the incidence of adverse events in patients with obesity during painless gastroscopy. Thus, this method is worthy of clinical application.

Volumetric and microstructural abnormalities of the amygdala in focal epilepsy with varied levels of SUDEP risk.,"Although the mechanisms of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are not yet well understood, generalised- or focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (TCS) are a major risk factor. Previous studies highlighted alterations in structures linked to cardio-respiratory regulation; one structure, the amygdala, was enlarged in people at high risk of SUDEP and those who subsequently died. We investigated volume changes and the microstructure of the amygdala in people with epilepsy at varied risk for SUDEP since that structure can play a key role in triggering apnea and mediating blood pressure. The study included 53 healthy subjects and 143 patients with epilepsy, the latter separated into two groups according to whether TCS occur in years before scan. We used amygdala volumetry, derived from structural MRI, and tissue microstructure, derived from diffusion MRI, to identify differences between the groups. The diffusion metrics were obtained by fitting diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) models. The analyses were performed at the whole amygdala level and at the scale of amygdaloid nuclei. Patients with epilepsy showed larger amygdala volumes and lower neurite density indices (NDI) than healthy subjects; the left amygdala volumes were especially enhanced. Microstructural changes, reflected by NDI differences, were more prominent on the left side and localized in the lateral, basal, central, accessory basal and paralaminar amygdala nuclei; basolateral NDI lowering appeared bilaterally. No significant microstructural differences appeared between epilepsy patients with and without current TCS. The central amygdala nuclei, with prominent interactions from surrounding nuclei of that structure, project to cardiovascular regions and respiratory phase switching areas of the parabrachial pons, as well as to the periaqueductal gray. Consequently, they have the potential to modify blood pressure and heart rate, and induce sustained apnea or apneusis. The findings here suggest that lowered NDI, indicative of reduced dendritic density, could reflect an impaired structural organization influencing descending inputs that modulate vital respiratory timing and drive sites and areas critical for blood pressure control.","Legouhy Antoine, Allen Luke A, Vos Sjoerd B, Oliveira Joana F A, Kassinopoulos Michalis, Winston Gavin P, Duncan John S, Ogren Jennifer A, Scott Catherine, Kumar Rajesh, Lhatoo Samden D, Thom Maria, Lemieux Louis, Harper Ronald M, Zhang Hui, Diehl Beate",Epilepsy research,2023,37068421,,10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2023.107139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37068421,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Efficacy of in-situ simulation training using evaluation checklists for sudden oxygen supply failure during general anesthesia: A preliminary report.,"Sudden oxygen supply failure (OSF) is a life-threatening consequence that may be triggered by natural disasters. Anesthesiologists are required to manage OSF promptly in such catastrophic situations. However, the current evidence regarding the efficacy of anesthesia training for sudden OSF is insufficient. This preliminary study aimed to introduce our in-situ simulation training utilizing evaluation checklists for a sudden OSF situation during general anesthesia and to evaluate the efficacy of the training program for anesthesia providers. This is a preliminary single-center, prospective study. We developed an OSF simulation scenario utilizing evaluation checklists with key actions to manage OSF. The training session comprised four components: orientation, benchmark evaluation (pre-test) according to the checklists, a short didactic lecture, and post-lecture evaluation (post-test). The scenario comprised two steps wherein the participants were supposed to utilize different oxygen supply sources immediately after OSF (Step 1) and minimize the amount of oxygen consumption (Step 2). Fifteen anesthesia providers were enrolled. The score for all anesthesia providers in the post-test was significantly higher than that in the pre-test (median 8 [IQR: 8, 8], 3 [IQR: 3, 4], <i>P</i> < 0.001, respectively). The successful performance rates of all anesthesia providers in one key action of all the four in Step 1 and four of all the six in Step 2 were significantly higher in the post-test than in the pre-test.

Cadaveric study investigating the femoral nerve-sparing volume for pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block.,"This cadaveric study investigated the maximum effective volume of dye in 90% of cases (MEV90) required to stain the iliac bone between the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and the iliopubic eminence (IPE) while sparing the femoral nerve during the performance of pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block. In cadaveric hemipelvis specimens, the ultrasound transducer was placed in a transverse orientation, medial and caudal to the anterior superior iliac spine in order to identify the AIIS, the IPE and the psoas tendon. Using an in-plane technique and a lateral-to-medial direction, the block needle was advanced until its tip contacted the iliac bone. The dye (0.1% methylene blue) was injected between the periosteum and psoas tendon. Successful femoral-sparing PENG block was defined as the non-staining of the femoral nerve on dissection. Volume assignment was carried out using a biased coin design, whereby the volume of dye administered to each cadaveric specimen depended on the response of the previous one. In case of failure (ie, stained femoral nerve), the next one received a lower volume (defined as the previous volume with a decrement of 2 mL). If the previous cadaveric specimen had a successful block (ie, non-stained femoral nerve), the next one was randomized to a higher volume (defined as the previous volume with an increment of 2 mL), with a probability of b=1/9, or the same volume, with a probability of 1-b=8/9. A total of 32 cadavers (54 cadaveric hemipelvis specimens) were included in the study. Using isotonic regression and bootstrap CI, the MEV90 for femoral-sparing PENG block was estimated to be 13.2 mL (95% CI: 12.0 to 20.0). The probability of a successful response was estimated to be 0.93 (95% CI: 0.81 to 1.00). For PENG block, the MEV90 of methylene blue required to spare the femoral nerve in a cadaveric model is 13.2 mL. Further studies are required to correlate this finding with the MEV90 of local anesthetic in live subjects.","Leurcharusmee Prangmalee, Kantakam Perada, Intasuwan Pittayarat, Malatong Yanumart, Maikong Naraporn, Navic Pagorn, Kitcharanant Nitchanant, Mahakkanukrauh Pasuk, Tran De Q",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,2023,37028817,,10.1136/rapm-2023-104419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37028817,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
<i>In vivo</i> microstructural investigation of the human tympanic membrane by endoscopic polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography.,"Endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) is of growing interest for <i>in vivo</i> diagnostics of the tympanic membrane (TM) and the middle ear but generally lacks a tissue-specific contrast. To assess the collagen fiber layer within the <i>in vivo</i> TM, an endoscopic imaging method utilizing the polarization changes induced by the birefringent connective tissue was developed. An endoscopic swept-source OCT setup was redesigned and extended by a polarization-diverse balanced detection unit. Polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT) data were visualized by a differential Stokes-based processing and the derived local retardation. The left and right ears of a healthy volunteer were examined. Distinct retardation signals in the annulus region of the TM and near the umbo revealed the layered structure of the TM. Due to the TM's conical shape and orientation in the ear canal, high incident angles onto the TM's surface, and low thicknesses compared to the axial resolution limit of the system, other regions of the TM were more difficult to evaluate. The use of endoscopic PS-OCT is feasible to differentiate birefringent and nonbirefringent tissue of the human TM <i>in vivo</i>. Further investigations on healthy as well as pathologically altered TMs are required to validate the diagnostic potential of this technique.","Steuer Svea, Morgenstern Joseph, Kirsten Lars, Bornitz Matthias, Neudert Marcus, Koch Edmund, Golde Jonas",Journal of biomedical optics,2023,37007626,PMC10050973,10.1117/1.JBO.28.12.121203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37007626,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10050973,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

"Immersive medium for early clinical exposure - knowledge acquisition, spatial orientation and the unexpected role of annotation in 360° VR photos.","360° VR photos could be a low-threshold possibility to increase early clinical exposure. Apart from granting insights into local routines and premises, the medium should facilitate knowledge acquisition and spatial orientation depending on its design. This assumption, however, is not yet substantiated empirically. Thus, three hypotheses were tested in consideration of Mayer's modality principle: 1) Providing 360° VR photos as visual reference improves retention and comprehension of information. 2) The annotation of text boxes in 360° VR photos compromises spatial orientation and presence. 3) Annotated audio commentary is superior to annotated text boxes in terms of cognitive load and knowledge acquisition. Using head-mounted displays, students of human (N=53) and dental medicine (N=8) completed one of three virtual tours through a surgical unit, which were created with 360° VR photos. In the first two variants, information about the facilities, medical devices and clinical procedures was annotated either as text boxes or audio commentary comprising 67 words on average (SD=6.67). In the third variant, the same information was given separately on a printed handout before the virtual tour. Taking user experience and individual learner characteristics into account, differences between conditions were measured regarding retention, comprehension, spatial orientation, cognitive load, and presence. Concerning retention and comprehension of information, annotated text boxes outperformed annotated audio commentary and the handout condition. Although annotated audio commentary exhibited the lowest knowledge test scores, students preferred listening over reading. Students with an interest in VR and 360° media reported higher levels of enjoyment and presence. Regarding spatial orientation and presence, no significant group differences were found. 360° VR photos can convey information and a sense of spatial orientation effectively in the same learning scenario. For students, their use is both enjoyable and instructive. Unexpectedly, the ideal mode of annotation is not dictated by Mayer's modality principle. For information like in this study, annotated text boxes are better for knowledge acquisition than the subjectively preferred audio commentary. This finding is probably contingent on the length and the quality of the annotated text. To identify boundary conditions and to validate the findings, more research is required on the design and educational use of 360° VR photos.","Speidel Robert, Schneider Achim, Walter Steffen, Grab-Kroll Claudia, Oechsner Wolfgang",GMS journal for medical education,2023,36923314,PMC10010766,10.3205/zma001590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36923314,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10010766,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Moral Orientation, Moral Decision-Making, and Moral Distress Among Critical Care Physicians: A Qualitative Study.","Moral distress is common among critical care physicians and can impact negatively healthcare individuals and institutions. Better understanding inter-individual variability in moral distress is needed to inform future wellness interventions. To explore when and how critical care physicians experience moral distress in the workplace and its consequences, how physicians' professional interactions with colleagues affected their perceived level of moral distress, and in which circumstances professional rewards were experienced and mitigated moral distress. Interview-based qualitative study using inductive thematic analysis. Twenty critical care physicians practicing in Canadian ICUs who expressed interest in participating in a semi-structured interview after completion of a national, cross-sectional survey of moral distress in ICU physicians. Study participants described different ways to perceive and resolve morally challenging clinical situations, which were grouped into four clinical moral orientations: virtuous, resigned, deferring, and empathic. Moral orientations resulted from unique combinations of strength of personal moral beliefs and perceived power over moral clinical decision-making, which led to different rationales for moral decision-making. Study findings illustrate how sociocultural, legal, and clinical contexts influenced individual physicians' moral orientation and how moral orientation altered perceived moral distress and moral satisfaction. The degree of dissonance between individual moral orientations within care team determined, in part, the quantity of ""negative judgments"" and/or ""social support"" that physicians obtained from their colleagues. The levels of moral distress, moral satisfaction, social judgment, and social support ultimately affected the type and severity of the negative consequences experienced by ICU physicians. An expanded understanding of moral orientations provides an additional tool to address the problem of moral distress in the critical care setting. Diversity in moral orientations may explain, in part, the variability in moral distress levels among clinicians and likely contributes to interpersonal conflicts in the ICU setting. Additional investigations on different moral orientations in various clinical environments are much needed to inform the design of effective systemic and institutional interventions that address healthcare professionals' moral distress and mitigate its negative consequences.","Piquette Dominique, Burns Karen E A, Carnevale Franco, Sarti Aimée J, Hamilton Mika, Dodek Peter M",Critical care explorations,2023,36895887,PMC9990831,10.1097/CCE.0000000000000879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36895887,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9990831,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The efficacy of nalmefene on anesthetic recovery of patients: a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"So far, the recovery quality after general anesthesia is still unsatisfied. Nalmefene is a drug to treat opioid overdose and reverse opioid actions. We aim to investigate the efficacy of nalmefene on optimizing the recovery quality of patients after general anesthesia. It is a prospective, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel groups, multicentre, double-blind, randomized (PPPMDR) clinical trial. The participants (n = 520) will be randomly assigned into two groups. Each patient will receive either: a single dose of nalmefene 0.25 µg/kg in the intervention group, or the same volume of 0.9% NaCl solution in the control group at the end of the surgery. The primary outcome will be the time interval between the end of anaesthesia and recovery endpoints achieved (Aldrete recovery score ≥ 9) in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The other variables are the time interval from the end of operation to extubation; Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score at extubation; the time at Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) orientation score ≥ 5; visual analog scale (VAS) score and adverse effects including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and pruritus in PACU and 24 h postoperatively. This trial aims to study whether small dose of nalmefene can shorten the time from the end of surgery to Aldrete score ≥ 9 and improve opioid-induced side effects.This trial focuses on providing the reliable clinical evidence for satisfactory quality of recovery.

Public information needs and preferences on COVID-19: a cross-sectional study.,"Right from the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic the general public faced the challenge to find reliable and understandable information in the overwhelming flood of information. To enhance informed decision-making, evidence-based information should be provided. Aim was to explore the general public's information needs and preferences on COVID-19 as well as the barriers to accessing evidence-based information. We performed a cross-sectional study. Nine hundred twenty-seven panel members were invited to an online survey (12/2020-02/2021). The HeReCa-online-panel is installed at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg to assess regularly the general public's view on health issues in five regions in Germany. The survey was set up in LimeSurvey, with nine items, multiple-choice and open-ended questions that allowed to gather qualitative data. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and a content analysis was carried out to categorise the qualitative data. Six hundred thirty-six panel members provided data; mean age 52 years, 56.2% female, and 64.9% with higher education qualifications. Asked about relevant topics related to COVID-19, most participants selected vaccination (63.8%), infection control (52%), and long-term effects (47.8%). The following 11 categories were derived from the qualitative analysis representing the topics of interest: vaccination, infection control, long-term effects, therapies, test methods, mental health, symptoms, structures for pandemic control, infrastructure in health care, research. Participants preferred traditional media (TV 70.6%; radio 58.5%; newspaper 32.7%) to social media, but also used the internet as sources of information, becoming aware of new information on websites (28.5%) or via email/newsletter (20.1%). The knowledge question (Which European country is most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic?) was correctly answered by 7.5% of participants. The Robert Koch Institute (93.7%) and the World Health Organization (78%) were well known, while other organisations providing health information were rarely known (< 10%). Barriers to accessing trustworthy information were lack of time (30.7%), little experience (23.1%), uncertainty about how to get access (22.2%), complexity and difficulties in understanding (23.9%), and a lack of target group orientation (15,3%). There are extensive information needs regarding various aspects on COVID-19 among the general population. In addition, target-specific dissemination strategies are still needed to reach different groups.","Lühnen Julia, Frese Thomas, Mau Wilfried, Meyer Gabriele, Mikolajczyk Rafael, Richter Matthias, Schildmann Jan, Braunisch Matthias C, Fichtner Falk, Holzmann-Littig Christopher, Kranke Peter, Popp Maria, Schaaf Christian, Schmaderer Christoph, Seeber Christian, Werner Anne, Wijnen-Meijer Marjo, Meerpohl Joerg J, Steckelberg Anke",BMC public health,2023,36849938,PMC9969022,10.1186/s12889-023-15131-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36849938,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9969022,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Mechanism of Enantioselective Neurosteroid Actions on GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors.,"The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) and pregnanolone (PREG), are equally effective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Interestingly, the PAM effects of ALLO are strongly enantioselective, whereas those of PREG are not. This study was aimed at determining the basis for this difference in enantioselectivity. The oocyte electrophysiology studies showed that <i>ent</i>-ALLO potentiates GABA-elicited currents in α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with lower potency and efficacy than ALLO, PREG or <i>ent</i>-PREG. The small PAM effect of <i>ent</i>-ALLO was prevented by the α<sub>1</sub>(Q242L) mutation in the intersubunit neurosteroid binding site between the β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> subunits. Consistent with this result, neurosteroid analogue photolabeling with mass spectrometric readout, showed that <i>ent</i>-ALLO binds weakly to the β<sub>3</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> intersubunit binding site in comparison to ALLO, PREG and <i>ent</i>-PREG. Rigid body docking predicted that <i>ent</i>-ALLO binds in the intersubunit site with a preferred orientation 180° different than ALLO, PREG or <i>ent</i>-PREG, potentially explaining its weak binding and effect. Photolabeling studies did not identify differences between ALLO and <i>ent</i>-ALLO binding to the α<sub>1</sub> or β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit binding sites that also mediate neurosteroid modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The results demonstrate that differential binding of <i>ent</i>-ALLO and <i>ent</i>-PREG to the β<sub>3</sub>-α<sub>1</sub> intersubunit site accounts for the difference in enantioselectivity between ALLO and PREG.","Tateiwa Hiroki, Chintala Satyanarayana M, Chen Ziwei, Wang Lei, Amtashar Fatima, Bracamontes John, Germann Allison L, Pierce Spencer R, Covey Douglas F, Akk Gustav, Evers Alex S",Biomolecules,2023,36830708,PMC9953308,10.3390/biom13020341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36830708,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953308,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A new inexpensive ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization simulation model.,"Central venous catheters (CVCs) are life-saving tools for fluid therapy during surgery. Ultrasound-guided CVC placement has been shown to be safe and highly efficient. However, it is difficult for medical workers with less experience in ultrasonography to acquire the necessary skill in a short time. Simulation-based training is a good way to enhance the skill of a beginner. Therefore, in this study, we introduced a new, inexpensive and easily implemented model for ultrasound-guided CVC placement training and assessed the feasibility of this model. This was a quasi-experimental study. Thirty-three anaesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents with strong CVC interest were included in a simulator-based training workshop in a department of anaesthesiology. The simulation model consisted of a piece of pork and two latex catheters filled with red and blue ink. The workshop comprised 3 parts: a 10-min introductory lecture, a 15-min orientation on performing ultrasound-guided CVC insertion based on the model, and a 30-min practice session. Participants completed relevant questionnaires before and after the training. Moreover, an examination was held to evaluate their skill with the novel model. All participants indicated that the novel model increased their self-perceived confidence in ultrasound-guided catheterization. They also all reported that the model was adequate for training anaesthesiology residents in ultrasound-guided catheterization. A few individuals thought the model did not mimic the progress of CVC insertion (3 of 33). After training, participants did not show a significant difference in the acquisition of central venous catheterization theory. However, their competency with ultrasound-guided CVC placement was enhanced. This was demonstrated not only based on subjective answers to the following questions, namely, ""how do you perform central venous catheterization with ultrasound guidance?"" (p < 0.001), ""can you perform ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization?"" (p < 0.001), and ""how much self-confidence do you have in performing ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization?"" (p < 0.001), but also in objective performance (evaluation of the core step in ultrasound-guided placement (p < 0.001)). The new simulator is a feasible, inexpensive and easily reproducible tool for training anaesthesiologists in ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization. After the simulation-based training workshop, the competency of residents in performing central venous catheterization with ultrasound guidance improved.","Liu Yan, Li Jiemei, Chang Jinzhu, Xiao Shaoling, Pei Wenbo, Wang Lei",BMC medical education,2023,36774471,PMC9921340,10.1186/s12909-023-04080-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36774471,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9921340,TRUE,Simulation-based training workshop using a new inexpensive ultrasound-guided CVC placement model,Anesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents,Improved competency and self-confidence in performing ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization,TRUE,Simulation-based training workshop for ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization,Anaesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents with strong CVC interest,Enhanced competency in ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization
Pediatric Project ECHO<sup>®</sup> for Pain: implementation and mixed methods evaluation of a virtual medical education program to support interprofessional pain management in children and youth.,"Pediatric pain is a complex health challenge requiring a multi-modal management approach. It is critical that healthcare providers (HCPs) have access to ongoing, flexible education and mentorship specific to pediatric pain. However, there are significant gaps in available pain education and a need for more opportunities to support interprofessional training. Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is a model for delivering online HCP education and cultivating a virtual community of practice. Within the pediatric pain setting, ECHO® has potential to improve local access to specialized pain knowledge, particularly among the physicians, nurses, and allied health providers who primarily manage these cases in community and hospital settings across rural and urban environments. The purpose of this study was three-fold. First, to evaluate the feasibility (participation levels, acceptability) of implementing Project ECHO® in the context of pediatric pain. Second, to measure preliminary program impacts on HCP knowledge, self-efficacy, and clinical practice. Third, to characterize HCP program engagement levels before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A needs assessment was conducted to identify interprofessional education gaps and inform the program curriculum. The no-cost Pediatric ECHO® for Pain program offered TeleECHO sessions (didactic and case-based learning) as well as foundational education. Surveys were distributed at baseline and 6 months to assess outcomes using 7-point Likert scales. Participant engagement was assessed for periods prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted. Eighty-five TeleECHO sessions were hosted, with a mean attendance of 34.1 ± 23.4 HCPs. Acceptability scores at 6 months (n = 33) ranged from 5.0 ± 1.4 to 6.5 ± 0.5. Participants reported statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements in knowledge (7 out of 7 topics) and self-efficacy (8 out of 9 skills). Most participants reported positive practice impacts, including improved satisfaction with managing children with pain. Exploratory analyses showed a trend of greater engagement from ECHO® learners after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project ECHO® is a feasible and impactful model for virtual education of interprofessional HCPs in managing pediatric pain.","Lalloo C, Mohabir V, Campbell F, Sun N, Klein S, Tyrrell J, Mesaroli G, Ataollahi-Eshqoor S, Osei-Twum J, Stinson J",BMC medical education,2023,36709273,PMC9883812,10.1186/s12909-023-04023-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36709273,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9883812,TRUE,Project ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) - a virtual medical education program offering TeleECHO sessions (didactic and case-based learning) and foundational education for pediatric pain management,"Interprofessional healthcare providers (HCPs) including physicians, nurses, and allied health providers who manage pediatric pain cases in community and hospital settings across rural and urban environments","Improved HCP knowledge, self-efficacy, and clinical practice in pediatric pain management; creation of a virtual community of practice; improved local access to specialized pain knowledge",TRUE,Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) model for delivering online HCP education and cultivating a virtual community of practice.

Application of opioid-free general anesthesia for gynecological laparoscopic surgery under ERAS protocol: a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.,"Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is now widely used in various surgical fields including gynecological laparoscopic surgery, but the advantages of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) in gynecological laparoscopic surgery under ERAS protocol are inexact. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of OFA technique versus traditional opioid-based anesthesia (OA) technique in gynecological laparoscopic surgery under ERAS. Adult female patients aged 18 ~ 65 years old undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery were randomly divided into OFA group (Group OFA, n = 39) with esketamine and dexmedetomidine or OA group (Group OA, n = 38) with sufentanil and remifentanil. All patients adopted ERAS protocol. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores (AUC<sub>VAS</sub>) postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative hemodynamic variables, awakening and orientation recovery times, number of postoperative rescue analgesia required, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) perioperatively. AUC<sub>VAS</sub> was (Group OFA, 16.72 ± 2.50) vs (Group OA, 15.99 ± 2.72) (p = 0.223). No difference was found in the number of rescue analgesia required (p = 0.352). There were no between-group differences in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) (p = 0.211 and 0.659, respectively) except MAP at time of surgical incision immediately [(Group OFA, 84.38 ± 11.08) vs. (Group OA, 79.00 ± 8.92), p = 0.022]. Times of awakening and orientation recovery in group OFA (14.54 ± 4.22 and 20.69 ± 4.92, respectively) were both longer than which in group OA (12.63 ± 3.59 and 18.45 ± 4.08, respectively) (p = 0.036 and 0.033, respectively). The incidence of PONV in group OFA (10.1%) was lower than that in group OA (28.9%) significantly (p = 0.027). The postoperative PSQI was lower than the preoperative one in group OFA (p = 0.013). In gynecological laparoscopic surgery under ERAS protocol, OFA technique is non-inferior to OA technique in analgesic effect and intraoperative anesthesia stability. Although awakening and orientation recovery times were prolonged compared to OA, OFA had lower incidence of PONV and improved postoperative sleep quality.

The relationship between the orientation of the lateral decubitus position for spinal anesthesia and positioning pain in patients with a femoral neck fracture: randomized non-inferiority trial.,"To date, no clinical studies have investigated the relationship between positioning pain and orientation of the lateral decubitus position for hip fracture surgery. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that performing spinal anesthesia in the lateral decubitus position with the fracture side up or down does not affect positioning pain in patients with a femoral neck fracture. This single-center, prospective, randomized non-inferiority trial examined 78 patients who received surgery for a femoral neck fracture under spinal anesthesia. By performing spinal anesthesia in the left lateral decubitus position in all patients, the positioning of the fracture up or down was randomized. Pain score during spinal anesthesia was evaluated objectively (0, calm; 1, facial grimacing; 2, moaning; 3, screaming; or 4, unable to proceed because of restlessness or agitation). The data from 66 patients (fracture side down [n = 35] and up [n = 31]) were analyzed. There were no significant differences between the fracture side down and fracture side up groups regarding the percentage of patients who were assessed to have intense pain (score ≥ 3) when changing position from the supine to lateral position (13/35 [37%] vs 12/31 [39%]; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] for the difference of the percentage of patients of intense pain between the groups - 25.0 to 2.2; p = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients experiencing severe pain between the two groups. The 95% CI exceeded the preliminarily set a margin of inferiority of 20%; thus, the present study could not demonstrate the non-inferiority of the fractured side down group in terms of pain score.","Yoshida Keisuke, Hareyama Itaru, Noji Yoshie, Tanaka Shiori, Watanabe Kazuhiro, Inoue Satoki",JA clinical reports,2023,36703010,PMC9879737,10.1186/s40981-023-00595-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36703010,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9879737,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Superficial anatomic landmarks can be used to triangulate the location of canine peripheral lymphocentrums: superficial cervical, axillary, and superficial inguinal.","To utilize the geometry of superficial anatomic landmarks to guide incisional location and orientation for peripheral lymphadenectomy, document deep anatomic landmarks for lymphocentrum identification, and develop novel surgical approaches to the superficial cervical, axillary, and superficial inguinal lymphocentrums in dogs. 12 canine cadavers. 2 cadavers were used for a pilot investigation to determine optimal body positioning, select superficial anatomic landmarks for lymphocentrum identification, and evaluate novel surgical approaches to the 3 lymphocentrums. These lymphocentrums were then dissected in 10 additional cadavers using these novel surgical approaches. Measurements of the distances from lymphocentrum to landmark and between landmarks were obtained for each lymphocentrum. Deep anatomic landmarks were recorded for each dissection. The mean and SD were calculated for each measurement and used to develop geometric guidelines for estimating the location of each lymphocentrum for these surgical approaches. Each peripheral lymphocentrum was found in the same location relative to the respective, predetermined, superficial, anatomic boundaries in all cadavers. Briefly, the superficial landmarks to each lymphocentrum were as follows: (1) superficial cervical: wing of atlas, acromion process of scapula, greater tubercle of humerus; (2) axillary: caudal border of transverse head of superficial pectoral muscle, caudal triceps muscle, ventral midline; and (3) superficial inguinal: origin of pectineus muscle, ipsilateral inguinal mammary gland, ventral midline. The proposed superficial and deep surgical landmarks were identified within every cadaver. The previously undescribed surgical approaches were effective for lymphocentrum identification. Anatomic landmarks provided in this study may help reduce surgical time and tissue trauma during peripheral lymphadenectomy in dogs. This study was also the first to describe a surgical approach to the superficial inguinal lymphocentrum and ventral approaches to the superficial cervical and axillary lymphocentrums and provided previously unpublished anatomic landmarks for a lateral approach to the superficial cervical lymphocentrum.","Worden Natalie J, Bertran Judith, Watt Meghan M, Reynolds Penny S, de Mello Souza Carlos H, Maxwell Elizabeth A, Adin Christopher A, Ham Kathleen, Regier Penny J",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,2023,36701220,,10.2460/javma.22.11.0518,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36701220,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Clinical observation of different dosages of dexmedetomidine combined with a target-controlled infusion of propofol in hysteroscopic submucosal myomectomy.,"This study aimed to explore the clinical effects of different dosages of dexmedetomidine (Dex) combined with a target-controlled infusion of propofol in hysteroscopic submucosal myomectomy. Ninety patients who underwent hysteroscopic submucosal myomectomy between September 2021 and March 2022 were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups, with 30 patients in each group. Patients in Groups A, B, and C received injections of 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 µg/kg of Dex, respectively, by intravenous pump over 10 min. After this time, a maintenance dosage of 0.5 µg/kg/h was administered by intravenous infusion until the end of the surgery. Anesthesia was induced using 1.5 mg/kg of propofol and 0.3 µg/kg of sufentanil that were introduced through a laryngeal mask. The plasma concentration of propofol was maintained at 3 µg/ml by target-controlled infusion until the end of the surgery. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS) were observed when the patient entered the operating room (T0), after catheter indwelling for anesthesia (T1), at the time of cervical dilation (T2), at the time of hysteroscopic surgery (T3), and at the end of the surgery (T4) in all three groups. The total dosage of propofol for induction and maintenance, anesthesia awakening time, orientation recovery time, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of the post-awakening uterine contraction pain, and adverse reactions were recorded. The intraoperative reductions of MAP and HR in patients were significant in Group C when compared with those in Groups A and B (<i>P </i>< 0.05), and BIS was significantly lower in Group C at T2 and T3 when compared with the baseline measurement at T0 (<i>P </i>< 0.05). The dosage of propofol was significantly higher for Group A than for Groups B and C (<i>P </i>< 0.05). The anesthesia awakening time and orientation recovery time were significantly longer for patients in Group C when compared with patients in Groups A and B (<i>P </i>< 0.05). Within 5-30 min after awakening, the VAS scores in Groups B and C were significantly lower than those for Group A (<i>P </i>< 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in Group B was significantly less than that for Groups A and C (<i>P </i>< 0.05). The continuous pumping of 0.5 µg/kg of Dex combined with a target-controlled infusion of propofol in hysteroscopic submucosal myomectomy resulted in positive anesthetic and analgesia effects and fewer adverse reactions.

Mental disorders are no predictors to determine the duration of cannabis-based treatment for chronic pain.,"Chronic pain (CP), a complex biopsychosocial disorder with a global prevalence of up to 33%, can be treated by following multidisciplinary approaches that may include cannabis-based medicine (CBM). However, because CBM continues to be a new treatment, questions remain regarding the ideal duration for CBM and its psychosocial determinants, including mental comorbidities. In a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 46 patients with CP (ICD-10 code F45.4-), three validated instruments-the German Pain Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), and the Marburg Questionnaire of Habitual WellBeing-were used to identify pain-specific psychosocial determinants and mental disorders. Descriptive analyses, a group differences analysis, and a logistic regression analysis were performed using SPSS. The patients most frequently reported low back pain as the primary location of their CP, and in attributing the condition to tissue damage, most had largely adopted a somatic orientation in conceptualizing their illness. Most had experienced CP for more than 5 years (<i>M</i> = 5.13 years, SD = 1.41) and, as a consequence, faced significant restrictions in their everyday life and exhibited low subjective wellbeing (MFHW median = 4.00, <i>N</i> = 43, Q1: 2.00, Q3: 9.00, range: 0-20). Comorbidities among the patients included depression, (DASS-Depression, median: 11.50, Q1: 7.00, Q3: 16.25), anxiety (DASS-Anxiety, median: 4.50, Q1: 2.75, Q3: 8.00), and stress (DASS-Stress, median: 11.00, Q1: 7.00, Q3: 15.00). Between the two cannabis-based treatments with a course lasting either less or more than a year, the duration of treatment showed no between-group differences in terms of sociodemographic factors, pain-specific factors, conceptualizations of the illness, or mental disorders. Psychosocial determinants such as subjective wellbeing and mental comorbidities were not significant predictors of the duration of cannabis-based treatment. We found no evidence indicating that the benefits of short-term vs. long-term cannabis-based treatment can be predicted by mental comorbidities or psychosocial factors. However, because CBM may be included in approaches to treat CP, questions about the ideal duration of such treatment remain to be answered.","Rometsch Caroline, Ott Stephan, Festl-Wietek Teresa, Jurjut Anna-Maria, Schlisio Barbara, Zipfel Stephan, Stengel Andreas, Herrmann-Werner Anne",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,36684012,PMC9853059,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1033020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36684012,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853059,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

This report summarizes the results of a formative evaluation of the orientation session at The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic to determine whether patients perceived the orientation session as beneficial. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and then thematically analyzed to understand patients' perspectives on the orientation session. Coding was done by two team members using the constant comparison analyses method with key ideas, concepts, and patterns identified and compared to identify similarities. Between September 6 and October 18, 2019, 18 patients attended an orientation session and 12 consented to participation and completed telephone interviews. The six themes identified included (1) feeling of community, (2) participants feeling heard by providers, (3) appreciation of the holistic approach, (4) availability of community resources, (5) barriers to access, and (6) discordant feelings of preparedness for the physician appointment.

Women Authorship Trends in the Highest-Impact Anesthesiology Journals from 2005 to 2021.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Although women and men have matriculated into medical schools in similar proportions since the 1980s, recent data indicate that anesthesiology is lagging in gender equity, especially in academic leadership roles.<sup>1,2</sup> As promotion in academic medicine is strongly influenced by publications, understanding whether a lack of women authorship is contributing to this gender gap is crucial.<sup>3,4</sup> This article aims to assess how woman authorship trends have changed in the last 16 years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The five highest impact journals in anesthesia were identified as <i>Journal of Clinical Anesthesia, British Journal of Anaesthesia</i>, <i>Anesthesiology</i>, <i>PAIN</i>, and <i>Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine</i>. Number of total authors, including women, men, and unknown gender authors as well as incidence of woman first and/or last author, was documented from articles published in 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2021. <b><i>Results:</i></b> This analysis shows that women are gaining representation in anesthesia publications. Overall, there was a statistically significant increase in the total number of women authors and women first and last authorship. However, as of 2021, women still only represented ∼40% of total and first authors and ∼24% of last authors. In addition, increase in first/last woman authorship was not present in all journals when stratified. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> These journal differences may suggest the editorial evaluation process as a potential source of gender bias. There was a statistically significant relationship between women senior authors and articles with 50% or more women authors, indicating that woman mentorship is contributing to closing equity gap. These data present a starting point for further investigations into gender disparities within anesthesia to continue the forward progression for women in academic medicine.","Keim Audrey A, Pelkey Melissa N, Broadfoot Jourdan E, Folley Tarrah A, Kraus Molly B, Maloney Jillian A, Strand Natalie H, Misra Lopa",Journal of women's health (2002),2023,36637854,,10.1089/jwh.2022.0532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36637854,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Modified and Extended Hospital Elder Life Program: A remote model of care to expand delirium prevention.,"Delirium is a common complication of hospitalization and is associated with poor outcomes. Multicomponent delirium prevention strategies such as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) have proven effective but rely on face-to-face intervention protocols and volunteer staff, which was not possible due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed the Modified and Extended Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP-ME), an innovative adaptation of HELP for remote and/or physically distanced applications. HELP-ME protocols were adapted from well-established multicomponent delirium prevention strategies and were implemented at four expert HELP sites. Each site contributed to the protocol modifications and compilation of a HELP-ME Operations Manual with standardized protocols and training instructions during three expert panel working groups. Implementation was overseen and monitored during seven learning sessions plus four coaching sessions from January 8, 2021, through September 24, 2021. Feasibility of implementing HELP-ME was measured by protocol adherence rates. Focus groups were conducted to evaluate the acceptability, provide feedback, and identify facilitators and barriers to implementation. A total of 106 patients were enrolled across four sites, and data were collected for 214 patient-days. Overall adherence was 82% (1473 completed protocols/1798 patient-days), achieving our feasibility target of >75% overall adherence. Individual adherence rates ranged from 55% to 96% across sites for the individual protocols. Protocols with high adherence rates included the nursing delirium protocol (96%), nursing medication review (96%), vision (89%), hearing (87%), and orientation (88%), whereas lower adherence occurred with fluid repletion (64%) and range-of-motion exercises (55%). Focus group feedback was generally positive for acceptability, with recommendations that an optimal approach would be hybrid, balancing in-person and remote interventions for potency and long-term sustainability. HELP-ME was fully implemented at four HELP sites, demonstrating feasibility and acceptability. Testing hybrid approaches and evaluating effectiveness is recommended for future work.","Fong Tamara G, Albaum Jason A, Anderson Molly L, Cohen Sara G, Johnson Shauni, Supiano Mark A, Vlisides Philip E, Wade Harley L, Weinberg Lyn, Wierman Heidi R, Zachary Wendy, Inouye Sharon K",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2023,36637405,PMC10023347,10.1111/jgs.18212,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36637405,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10023347,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Anaesthetic and peri-operative management for thrombectomy procedures in stroke patients.,"To provide recommendations for the anaesthetic and peri-operative management for thrombectomy procedure in stroke patients DESIGN: A consensus committee of 15 experts issued from the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (Société Française d'Anesthésie et Réanimation, SFAR), the Association of French-language Neuro-Anaesthetists (Association des Neuro-Anesthésistes Réanimateurs de Langue Francaise, ANARLF), the French Neuro-Vascular Society (Société Francaise de Neuro-Vasculaire, SFNV), the French Neuro-Radiology Society (Société Francaise de Neuro-Radiologie, SFNR) and the French Study Group on Haemostasis and Thrombosis (Groupe Français d'Études sur l'Hémostase et la Thrombose, GFHT) was convened, under the supervision of two expert coordinators from the SFAR and the ANARLF. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the outset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guideline elaboration process was conducted independently of any industry funding. The authors were required to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide their assessment of quality of evidence. Four fields were defined prior to the literature search: (1) Peri-procedural management, (2) Prevention and management of secondary brain injuries, (3) Management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments, (4) Post-procedural management and orientation of the patient. Questions were formulated using the PICO format (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes) and updated as needed. Analysis of the literature was then conducted and the recommendations were formulated according to the GRADE methodology. The SFAR/ANARLF/SFNV/SFNR/GFHT guideline panel drew up 18 recommendations regarding anaesthetic management of mechanical thrombectomy procedures. Due to a lack of data in the literature allowing to conclude with high certainty on relevant clinical outcomes, the experts decided to formulate these guidelines as ""Professional Practice Recommendations"" (PPR) rather than ""Formalized Expert Recommendations"". After two rounds of rating and several amendments, a strong agreement was reached on 100% of the recommendations. No recommendation could be formulated for two questions. Strong agreement among experts was reached to provide a sizable number of recommendations aimed at optimising anaesthetic management for thrombectomy in patients suffering from stroke.","Quintard Hervé, Degos Vincent, Mazighi Mikael, Berge Jérôme, Boussemart Pierre, Chabanne Russel, Figueiredo Samy, Geeraerts Thomas, Launey Yoann, Meuret Ludovic, Olivot Jean-Marc, Pottecher Julien, Rapido Francesca, Richard Sébastien, Saleme Suzana, Siguret-Depasse Virginie, Naggara Olivier, De Courson Hugues, Garnier Marc","Anaesthesia, critical care & pain medicine",2023,36599377,,10.1016/j.accpm.2022.101188,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36599377,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Intraurethral Instillation of Ketamine and Lidocaine versus Lidocaine for Male Rigid Cystoscopy: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background Male rigid cystoscopy is one of the most common outpatient procedures in urology because of it lower cost, better optical area and better orientation compared with flexible devices. However, performing rigid cystoscopy is not only painful but equally apprehensive in awake male patients. Objective The study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of lidocaine gel and ketamine solution together compared with lidocaine gel alone during male rigid cystoscopy. Method A total of 76 male patients who visited the hospital for rigid cystoscopy were randomized into two groups before undergoing cystoscopy. The experimental group received 15 ml lidocaine with 2 ml (100 mg) Ketamine solution while the control group received 15 ml lidocaine gel with 2 ml Normal saline. Patient's heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded in five minutes interval till twenty minutes after completion of the procedure. The level of pain perception of all the patients was measured with Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, at the beginning, during and after cystoscopy. Independent sample t-test was used to compare outcome measures and p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result Out of the total 70 patients analyzed at the end of study with 35 patients in each group, the VAS score in each stage were lower in lidocaine plus ketamine group compared to lidocaine gel alone. The difference was significant at the commencement and middle of the procedure (p < 0.05). Conclusion Intraurethral instillation of ketamine and lidocaine is more effective in reducing mean pain score during cystoscopy as compared to lidocaine alone.","Pradhan U, Chalise P R, Luitel B R, Kriti S, Devkota S",Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ),,39212009,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39212009,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

University of Montreal's Clinician-Investigator Program: A 10-Year Descriptive Evaluation.,"Clinician-investigators have an important role in the development and implantation of new therapies and treatment modalities; however, there have been several reports highlighting a pending shortage in the clinician-investigators' workforce. In Canada, the Royal College has promoted the development of clinician-investigators programs (CIP) to facilitate the training of these individuals. There is currently a paucity of data regarding the outcomes of such programs. This study aims to identify the strengths and areas of improvement of the Montreal University CIP.  Methods: An internet-based 51-question survey was distributed to all the alumni from the University of Montreal CIP. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were provided. The response rate was 64%.  Results: Among respondents, 50% (n=16) had completed their clinical residency and all CIP requirements. The majority of these individuals (63%) had become independent investigators and had secured provincial and national funding. Satisfaction of the respondents was high regarding the overall program (85%), the research skills developed during the CIP (84%) and the financial support obtained during the program (72%). The satisfaction rate regarding career planning was lower (63%).  Conclusion: This survey demonstrates that, while indicators are favorable, some areas still require improvement. Several steps to improve the CIP have been identified; notably, the transition from the CIP to early independent career has been identified as critical in the development of clinician-investigators and steps have been taken to improve this progression.","Mailhot-Larouche Samuel, Chauvette Vincent, Bergeron David, Larochelle Catherine, Du Pont-Thibodeau Geneviève, Wang Han, Cardinal Héloïse, Bourdeau Isabelle, Auger Nathalie, Bureau Nathalie Bureau Md MSc, Prat Alexandre, Jutras-Aswad Didier, Madore François, Emeriaud Guillaume, Bahig Houda, Mayrand Marie-Hélène, Tadros Rafik, Parent Stefan, Richebe Philippe Richebe Md PhD, Merhi Yahye, Nguyen Dang",Clinical and investigative medicine.

"Evaluation of the Stanford Anesthesiology Faculty Teaching Scholars Program Using the Context, Input, Process, and Product Framework.","Faculty development programs are essential to the educational mission of academic medical centers as they promote skill development and career advancement and should be regularly evaluated to determine opportunities for improvement. The context, input, process, and product (CIPP) framework evaluates all phases of a program and focuses on improvement and outcomes. The aim of this study was to use the CIPP framework to evaluate the Stanford Anesthesiology Faculty Teaching Scholars Program. Using the CIPP framework, a survey was developed for alumni (2007 to 2018) of the program, followed by structured interviews, and each interview was deductively coded to identify themes. Twenty-six of the 54 (48% response rate) participants in the program completed the survey, with 23 completing their projects and 17 of those projects still part of the anesthesiology training program. Seventeen survey responders went on to educational leadership roles. Twenty-five of the 26 survey responders would recommend this program to their colleagues. Fifteen structured interviews were conducted. Using the CIPP framework, themes were identified for context (reason for participation, previous experience in medical education, and resident education impact), input (benefits/negatives of the lecture series, availability of resources, and adequacy of nonclinical time), process (resident participation, mentorship, and barriers to implementation), and product (project completion, education sustainability, positive/negative outcomes of the program, and suggestions for improvement).

"Gender Disparities in Academic Pain Medicine: A Retrospective, Cross-Sectional Bibliometric Analysis.","This study was conducted to characterize the gender disparities within academic pain management departments in the United States, specifically focusing on its relation to research and academic leadership. This will allow for targeted improvements in efforts made to reduce gender gaps within academic pain medicine. This is a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis study evaluating pain management faculty of various positions at academic institutions across the United States. We utilized publicly available data on faculty positions and sex to analyze research impact, H-index, number of publications and citations through bibliometric and linear regression analysis. Our analysis found that female faculty had significantly less research output to male faculty. The three research measurement indices used in this study including H-index, number of publications, and number of citations were significantly lower in females than in males among associate and full professor faculty ranking. Multivariable analysis did not display any significant disparities of research output at the division director and department chair level. As in many areas of medicine, there continues to be a significant gender disparity in academic pain management departments, particularly with regard to leadership positions and research impact within the field. Our study found that female pain physicians had a significantly less research output based on the three variables of H indices, number of publications, and number of citations compared to their male counterparts. This has been shown to have the impact on discrepancies in female faculty ranking. Interestingly, these variables were not significantly different between male and female faculty members of the same level of leadership except for program director. There are various contributory reasons for these disparities, including implicit biases, lack of mentorship, and familial obligations. Addressing some of these factors can help narrow the schism and promote greater gender equality within academic pain management.","Patel Janki, Duong Anne, Tang Tuan, Cui Chen, Kohan Lynn, Abd-Elsayed Alaa, Ma Jennie Z",Journal of pain research,2022,36536696,PMC9758991,10.2147/JPR.S359069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36536696,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758991,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The S1 dorsal foramen: Nuances of anatomy.,"Access to the dorsal S1 neural foramen is frequently performed, but can be challenging. To report previously undescribed nuances of dorsal S1 foraminal anatomy, including a bony flange that may obstruct access to the foramen. Fluoroscopic - advanced imaging correlations of the S1 foraminal aperture were performed. The anatomy of the S1 foramen was examined in 27 cadaveric specimens (N ​= ​49 S1 foramina) and the foraminal and flange dimensions quantified. The S1 foramen was examined in 50 CT datasets (N ​= ​100 S1 foramina), and its dimensions quantified in PA and ipsilateral oblique orientations. The medial aspect of the S1 dorsal foramen is variably shielded by a bony flange, which extends from medial to lateral. The foraminal aperture is covered by a ligament extending from this flange to the lateral aspect of the foramen. On the cadaveric specimens, the mean vertical dimension of the foraminal aperture was 8.6 ​mm; the transverse dimension was 8.9 ​mm. The mean transverse dimension of the flange was 2.8 ​mm. The CT images demonstrated that the transverse dimension of the S1foraminal aperture increased from a mean of 6.23 ​mm in the PA orientation to 7.90 ​mm in the ipsilateral oblique. The bony flange at the S1 dorsal foramen shields its medial aspect; the flange on average covers one-third of the transverse dimension of the foramen, and in 14% covered one-half. The flange has little cortical bone at its margins and may be unseen at fluoroscopy. Ligamentous tissue extending laterally from the flange covers the remainder of the foramen. The transverse dimension of the foramen increased significantly from a posterior-anterior trajectory to an ipsilateral oblique trajectory, as the flange no longer obstructed access. Access to the S1 dorsal foramen may be confounded by an unseen bony flange covering its medial aspect. An ipsilateral oblique trajectory targeting the lateral margin of the foramen will maximize successful access.","Tiegs-Heiden Christin, Talsma Joel, Willard Frank, Maus Timothy, El-Yahchouchi Christine",Interventional pain medicine,2023,39239612,PMC11373015,10.1016/j.inpm.2022.100172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39239612,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11373015,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Association of Blood Pressure Variability with Delirium in Patients with Critical Illness.,"The objective was to examine the association of blood pressure variability (BPV) during the first 24 h after intensive care unit admission with the likelihood of delirium and depressed alertness without delirium (""depressed alertness""). This retrospective, observational, cohort study included all consecutive adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from July 1, 2004, through October 31, 2015. The primary outcomes were delirium and delirium-free days, and the secondary outcomes included depressed alertness and depressed alertness-free days. Logistic regression was performed to determine the association of BPV with delirium and depressed alertness. Proportional odds regression was used to assess the association of BPV with delirium-free days and depressed alertness-free days. Among 66,549 intensive care unit admissions, delirium was documented in 20.2% and depressed alertness was documented in 24.4%. Preserved cognition was documented in 55.4% of intensive care unit admissions. Increased systolic and diastolic BPV was associated with an increased odds of delirium and depressed alertness. The magnitude of the association per 5-mm Hg increase in systolic average real variability (the average of absolute value of changes between consecutive systolic blood pressure readings) was greater for delirium (odds ratio 1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.29-1.40; P < 0.001) than for depressed alertness (odds ratio 1.06; 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.10; P = 0.004). Increased systolic and diastolic BPV was associated with fewer delirium-free days but not with depressed alertness-free days. BPV in the first 24 h after intensive care unit admission is associated with an increased likelihood of delirium and fewer delirium-free days.","Zorko Garbajs Nika, Valencia Morales Diana J, Singh Tarun D, Herasevich Vitaly, Hanson Andrew C, Schroeder Darrell R, Weingarten Toby N, Gajic Ognjen, Sprung Juraj, Rabinstein Alejandro A",Neurocritical care,2023,36526945,PMC9757627,10.1007/s12028-022-01661-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36526945,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9757627,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Backbone amides are determinants of Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity in CLC ion channels.,"Chloride homeostasis is regulated in all cellular compartments. CLC-type channels selectively transport Cl<sup>-</sup> across biological membranes. It is proposed that side-chains of pore-lining residues determine Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity in CLC-type channels, but their spatial orientation and contributions to selectivity are not conserved. This suggests a possible role for mainchain amides in selectivity. We use nonsense suppression to insert α-hydroxy acids at pore-lining positions in two CLC-type channels, CLC-0 and bCLC-k, thus exchanging peptide-bond amides with ester-bond oxygens which are incapable of hydrogen-bonding. Backbone substitutions functionally degrade inter-anion discrimination in a site-specific manner. The presence of a pore-occupying glutamate side chain modulates these effects. Molecular dynamics simulations show backbone amides determine ion energetics within the bCLC-k pore and how insertion of an α-hydroxy acid alters selectivity. We propose that backbone-ion interactions are determinants of Cl<sup>-</sup> specificity in CLC channels in a mechanism reminiscent of that described for K<sup>+</sup> channels.","Leisle Lilia, Lam Kin, Dehghani-Ghahnaviyeh Sepehr, Fortea Eva, Galpin Jason D, Ahern Christopher A, Tajkhorshid Emad, Accardi Alessio",Nature communications,2022,36473856,PMC9726985,10.1038/s41467-022-35279-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36473856,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9726985,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Does cognitive frailty predict delayed neurocognitive recovery after noncardiac surgery in frail elderly individuals? Probably not.,"Delayed neurocognitive recovery (DNR) is a common post-surgical complication among the elderly. Cognitive frailty (CF) is also an age-related medical syndrome. However, little is known about the association between CF and DNR. Therefore, this study aimed to study whether CF is associated with DNR in elderly patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, as well as to explore the potential risk factors for DNR in frail elderly individuals and construct a prediction model. This prospective cohort study administered a battery of cognitive and frailty screening instruments for 146 individuals (≥65 years old) scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery. Screening for CF was performed at least one day before surgery, and tests for the presence of DNR were performed seven days after surgery. The association between CF and DNR was investigated. Moreover, the study subjects were randomly divided into a modeling group (70%) and a validation group (30%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze the modeling group data and identify the independent risk factors for DNR. The R software was used to construct DNR's nomogram model, verifying the model. In total, 138 individuals were eligible. Thirty-three cases were diagnosed with DNR (23.9%). No significant difference in the number of patients with CF was observed between the DNR and non-DNR groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Multivariate analysis after adjusting relevant risk factors showed that only the judgment of line orientation (JLOT) test score significantly affected the incidence of DNR. After internal validation of the constructed DNR prediction model, the area under the curve (AUC) of the forecast probability for the modeling population (<i>n</i> = 97) for DNR was 0.801, and the AUC for the validation set (<i>n</i> = 41) was 0.797. The calibration curves of both the modeling and validation groups indicate that the prediction model has good stability. Cognitive frailty is not an independent risk factor in predicting DNR after noncardiac surgery in frail elderly individuals. The preoperative JLOT score is an independent risk factor for DNR in frail elderly individuals. The prediction model has a good degree of discrimination and calibration, which means that it can individually predict the risk probability of DNR in frail elderly individuals.","Zhang Jingya, Basnet Diksha, Du Xue, Yang Junjun, Liu Jiehui, Wu Fan, Zhang Xiaoqing, Liu Jianhui",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,36457760,PMC9705765,10.3389/fnagi.2022.995781,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36457760,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9705765,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
In pursuit of a better transition to selected residencies: a quasi-experimental evaluation of a final year of medical school dedicated to the acute care domain.,"Medical schools seek the best curricular designs for the transition to postgraduate education, such as the Dutch elective-based final, 'transitional' year. Most Dutch graduates work a mean of three years as a physician-not-in-training (PNIT) before entering residency training. To ease the transition to selected specialties and to decrease the duration of the PNIT period, UMC Utrecht introduced an optional, thematic variant of the usual transitional year, that enables the development of theme-specific competencies, in addition to physicians' general competencies. We introduced an optional transitional year for interested students around the theme of acute care, called the Acute Care Transitional Year (ACTY). This study aimed to evaluate the ACTY by judging whether graduates meet postgraduate acute care expectations, indicating enhanced learning and preparation for practice. In a comprehensive assessment of acute care knowledge, clinical reasoning, skills, and performance in simulations, we collected data from ACTY students, non-ACTY students interested in acute care, and PNITs with approximately six months of acute care experience. ACTY graduates outperformed non-ACTY graduates on skills and simulations, and had higher odds of coming up to the expectations faculty have of a PNIT, as determined by global ratings. PNITs did better on simulations than ACTY graduates. ACTY graduates show better resemblance to PNITs than non-ACTY graduates, suggesting better preparation for postgraduate acute care challenges.

Publication type was restricted to article and review in the English language. The downloaded data were screened and analyzed in January 2022. In total, 16,264 publications were identified, with a steady increase in annual publications. The United States was the leading country in VCI research regarding publication numbers and national influence. National Institute of Aging had the highest influence among all the institutes in the field of VCI. Philip Scheltens was the most active author. The top five active authors' publications focused on pathobiology, neuroimaging standards, risk factors, prevention, and the standard diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD). A co-cited publication clustering resulted in 19 main clusters, and the prevention, blood-brain barrier, cholesterol, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and VaD were the top 5 clusters. Moreover, burst keywords detection revealed that the ""small vessel disease"" is the current hotspot in the field of VCI. This bibliometric analysis mapped the overall research structure of VCI and analyzed the current research trends and hotspots for future studies orientation.

The Feasibility and Effectiveness of an Online Curriculum for Virtual Onboarding/Orientation of Graduate Medical Education Learners During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Graduate medical education (GME) orientation/onboarding is conventionally an in-person activity, but the COVID-19 pandemic prompted virtual approaches to learner onboarding. However, online GME onboarding strategies have not been disseminated in the literature. To determine the usefulness of an online curriculum for GME learner orientation at a large sponsoring institution using an electronic survey. The primary outcome was to discover the usefulness of our online curriculum for GME onboarding, and secondary outcomes included identifying barriers to implementation and weaknesses associated with online GME orientation.

Comparative evaluation of King Vision videolaryngoscope channeled and non-channeled blades with direct laryngoscope for intubation performance and skill retention by medical students: a randomized cross over two period study.,"A videolaryngoscope(VL) with an intubation conduit like KingVision channeled(KVC) blade may provide an added advantage over a non-channeled VL like a KingVision non-channeled (KVNC) blade and direct laryngoscope (DL) for acquiring and retention of intubation skills, especially in novices. In this prospective two-period randomized crossover trial, one hundred medical students used three laryngoscopes KVC, KVNC and DL for intubation following standardized training with the study devices using a Laerdal Airway Management Trainer. After one month, all participants attempted intubation, in the same manner, using all devices. The duration of intubation, modified Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade, percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score, first-attempt success, number of attempts, ease of intubation and dental trauma was recorded. The retention of intubation skills after 1 month was also assessed on the same parameters. Median intubation times of KVC and DL were comparable and significantly better than KVNC (P < 0.001). The median POGO score was better with both videolaryngoscopes when compared with DL. The ease of intubation (P < 0.0012) and first-attempt success rate (P = 0.001) at the time '0' was significantly better with KVC compared to KVNC and DL. KVC fared better with respect to these intubation parameters during intubation after one month as well. KVC performed better in terms of time to intubation, success rate and ease of procedure as compared to KVNC and DL, both for acquisition and retention of skill.

The response rates were 60.5% (92 of 152) for the baseline, 51% (82 of 161) for the 6-month, and 52% (96 of 185) for the 14-month surveys. Five main themes were identified from the free-text responses in the 6- and 14-month surveys. Members reported that WELI helped them create meaningful connections through networking, obtain new career opportunities, find tools and projects that supported their career advancement and promotion, build the confidence to try new things beyond their comfort zone, and achieve better work-life integration. Frustration with the inability to connect in-person during the coronavirus-19 pandemic was highlighted. Advisors further stated that WELI helped them improve their mentorship skills and gave them insight into early career faculty issues. Relative to the baseline survey, protégés reported greater contributions from WELI at 6 months in helping them clarify their priorities, increase their sense of achievement, and get promoted. These benefits persisted through 14 months. Advisors reported a steady increase in forming new meaningful relationships and finding new collaborators through WELI over time. All the members reported that their self-rated mentoring abilities improved at 6 months with sustained improvement at 14 months. Thus, programs such as WELI can assist women anesthesiologists and foster gender equity in career development, promotion, and leadership.","Deutsch Nina, Yanofsky Samuel D, Markowitz Scott D, Tackett Sean, Berenstain Laura K, Schwartz Lawrence I, Flick Randall, Heitmiller Eugenie, Fiadjoe John, Lee Helen H, Honkanen Anita, Malviya Shobha, Lee Jennifer K, Schwartz Jamie McElrath",Paediatric anaesthesia,2023,36331372,,10.1111/pan.14596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36331372,,TRUE,"Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) - a mentorship program focused on six career development domains: promotion and leadership, networking, conceptualization and completion of projects, mentoring, career satisfaction, and sense of well-being",Women pediatric anesthesiologists,"Empowerment to achieve equity, promotion, and leadership; improved mentorship skills; career advancement; increased networking; better work-life integration; and greater gender equity in career development",TRUE,"The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) focuses on six career development domains: promotion and leadership, networking, conceptualization and completion of projects, mentoring, career satisfaction, and sense of well-being.",Women pediatric anesthesiologists,"Members reported that WELI helped them create meaningful connections through networking, obtain new career opportunities, find tools and projects that supported their career advancement and promotion, build the confidence to try new things beyond their comfort zone, and achieve better work-life integration.

Training digital natives to transform healthcare: a 5-tiered approach for integrating clinical informatics into undergraduate medical education.,"Expansive growth in the use of health information technology (HIT) has dramatically altered medicine without translating to fully realized improvements in healthcare delivery. Bridging this divide will require healthcare professionals with all levels of expertise in clinical informatics. However, due to scarce opportunities for exposure and training in informatics, medical students remain an underdeveloped source of potential informaticists. To address this gap, our institution developed and implemented a 5-tiered clinical informatics curriculum at the undergraduate medical education level: (1) a practical orientation to HIT for rising clerkship students; (2) an elective for junior students; (3) an elective for senior students; (4) a longitudinal area of concentration; and (5) a yearlong predoctoral fellowship in operational informatics at the health system level. Most students found these offerings valuable for their training and professional development. We share lessons and recommendations for medical schools and health systems looking to implement similar opportunities.","Hare Allison J, Soegaard Ballester Jacqueline M, Gabriel Peter E, Adusumalli Srinath, Hanson C William",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,36323268,PMC9748535,10.1093/jamia/ocac209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36323268,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9748535,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Role of Co-creation for Large-Scale Sustainable Adoption of Digitally Supported Integrated Care: Prehabilitation as Use Case.,"The efficacy-effectiveness gap constitutes a well-known limitation for adoption of digitally enabled integrated care services. The current report describes the co-creation process undertaken (2016-2021) to deploy a prehabilitation service at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona with the final aim of achieving sustainable adoption and facilitate site transferability. An implementation research approach with a population-based orientation, combining experience-based co-design and quality improvement methodologies, was applied. We undertook several design-thinking sessions (Oct-Nov 2017, June 2021 and December 2021) to generate and follow-up a work plan fostering service scalability. The implementation process was assessed using the Comprehensive Framework for Implementation Research, leading to the identification of key performance indicators. Personalization and modularity of the intervention according to patients' surgical risk were identified as core traits to enhance patients' adherence and value generation. A digitally enabled service workflow, with an adaptive and collaborative case management approach, should combine face-to-face and remotely supervised sessions with intelligent systems for patients' and professionals' decision support. The business model envisages operational costs financed by savings generated by the service. Evidence-based co-creation, combining appropriate methodologies and a structured evaluation framework, was key to address challenges associated with sustainable prehabilitation service adoption, scalability and transferability.","Baltaxe Erik, Cano Isaac, Risco Raquel, Sebio Raquel, Dana Fernando, Laxe Sara, Martínez Ramon, Ozores Fernando, Roca Josep, Martínez-Pallí Graciela",International journal of integrated care,2022,36304784,PMC9541166,10.5334/ijic.6503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36304784,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9541166,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Recommendations for anatomical structures to identify on ultrasound for the performance of intermediate and advanced blocks in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.,"Recent recommendations describe a set of core anatomical structures to identify on ultrasound for the performance of basic blocks in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA). This project aimed to generate consensus recommendations for core structures to identify during the performance of intermediate and advanced blocks. An initial longlist of structures was refined by an international panel of key opinion leaders in UGRA over a three-round Delphi process. All rounds were conducted virtually and anonymously. Blocks were considered twice in each round: for ""orientation scanning"" (the dynamic process of acquiring the final view) and for ""block view"" (which visualizes the block site and is maintained for needle insertion/injection). A ""strong recommendation"" was made if ≥75% of participants rated any structure as ""definitely include"" in any round. A ""weak recommendation"" was made if >50% of participants rated it as ""definitely include"" or ""probably include"" for all rounds, but the criterion for strong recommendation was never met. Structures which did not meet either criterion were excluded. Forty-one participants were invited and 40 accepted; 38 completed all three rounds. Participants considered the ultrasound scanning for 19 peripheral nerve blocks across all three rounds. Two hundred and seventy-four structures were reviewed for both orientation scanning and block view; a ""strong recommendation"" was made for 60 structures on orientation scanning and 44 on the block view. A ""weak recommendation"" was made for 107 and 62 structures, respectively. These recommendations are intended to help standardize teaching and research in UGRA and support widespread and consistent practice.","Ashken Toby, Bowness James, Macfarlane Alan James Robert, Turbitt Lloyd, Bellew Boyne, Bedforth Nigel, Burckett-St Laurent David, Delbos Alain, El-Boghdadly Kariem, Elkassabany Nabil M, Ferry Jenny, Fox Ben, French James L H, Grant Calum, Gupta Ashwani, Gupta Rajnish K, Gürkan Yavuz, Haslam Nat, Higham Helen, Hogg Rosemary M G, Johnston David F, Kearns Rachel Joyce, Lobo Clara, McKinlay Sonya, Mariano Edward R, Memtsoudis Stavros, Merjavy Peter, Narayanan Madan, Noble J Alison, Phillips David, Rosenblatt Meg, Sadler Amy, Sebastian Maria Paz, Schwenk Eric S, Taylor Alasdair, Thottungal Athmaja, Valdés-Vilches Luis Fernando, Volk Thomas, West Simeon, Wolmarans Morné, Womack Jonathan, Pawa Amit",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,2022,36283714,,10.1136/rapm-2022-103738,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36283714,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Neostigmine versus sugammadex on post-operative recovery following bariatric surgery.,"The purpose of our study was to compare the recovery characteristics and side effects of sugammadex (SM) and neostigmine (NT) in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Residual neuromuscular block is a serious condition that increases pulmonary complications after anesthesia. Although acetylcholinesterase inhibitors help reverse this block, they may be insufficient, especially when administered with inhalational anesthetics. SM, a selective antagonist, may be more effective in reversing the block. Patients were randomly divided into NT group (Group NT, n=34) and SM group (Group SM, n=34).For the induction, fentanil (1-1.5 µ/kg), propofol (2-3 mg/kg), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) were used.For the maintenance, 50% O<sub>2</sub> + air, 1% sevoflurane, and remifentanil (0.5-0.3 µg/kg/min) were used. Additional rocuronium was given to maintain the train of four (TOF) ratio ≤2. On completion of surgery and when the TOF ratio was 2, group NT received 50 µg/kg of NT with 20 µg/kg of atropine, whereas group SM received 2 mg/kg of SM. Hemodynamic parameters and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every 10 minfirst, and every 5 min after the reversal agents were given. When the TOF ratio was 0.9 or higher, time to reach a TOF ratio of 0.9, and time to extubation were recorded. Patients were observed in the recovery room for 30 min for adverse effects. Demographic characteristics of the patients and total rocuronium use in two groups were similar (p>0.05).Time to extubation, time to TOF ratio of 0.9, time until patients responded to stimuli, time until cooperation, and time until orientation were significantly shorter in the SM group than in the NT group. Time to reach the Aldrete score of 9 was also significantly shorter in the SM group (p<0.05).In the post-operative period, hemodynamic variables and side effects such asrespiratory difficulty, nausea, vomiting, hypo/hypertension, and presence of pain showed no statistically significant differences between the groups (p>0.05). Considering the high risk of post-operative respiratory insufficiency inmorbidly obese patients, SM could be a safer choice in this patient group.","Ekinci Osman, Gulmez Duygu Demiriz, Subasi Ferhunde Dilek, Ozgultekin Asu, Demiroluk Oznur",Northern clinics of Istanbul,2022,36276569,PMC9514077,10.14744/nci.2021.94715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36276569,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9514077,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Call to Action: A Specialty-Specific Course to Support the Next Generation of Clinician Scientists in Anesthesiology.,"Clinical production pressure is a significant problem for faculty of anesthesiology departments who seek to remain involved in research. Lack of protected time to dedicate to research and insufficient external funding add to this long-standing issue. Recent trends in funding to the departments of anesthesiology and their academic output validate these concerns. A 2022 study examining National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant recipients associated with anesthesiology departments across 10 years (2011-2020) outlines total awarded funds at $1,676,482,440, with most of the funds awarded to only 10 departments in the United States. Of note, the total 1-year NIH funding in 2021 for academic internal medicine departments was 3 times higher than the 10-year funding of anesthesiology departments. Additionally, American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) diplomats represent a minority (37%) of the anesthesiology researchers obtaining grant funding, with a small number of faculty members receiving a prevalence of monies. Overall, the number of publications per academic anesthesiologist across the United States remains modest as does the impact of the scholarly work. Improving environments in which academic anesthesiologists thrive may be paramount to successful academic productivity. In fact, adding to the lack of academic time is the limited bandwidth of senior academic physicians to mentor and support aspiring physician scientists. Given then the challenges for individual departments and notable successes of specialty-specific collaborative efforts (eg Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research [FAER]), additional pooled-resource approaches may be necessary to successfully support and develop clinician scientists. It is in this spirit that the leadership of <i>Anesthesia and Analgesia and the Journal of Education in Perioperative Medicine</i>, unified with the Association of University Anesthesiologists, aim to sponsor the Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course. Directed toward early career academic anesthesiologists who wish to gain competency specifically in the fundamentals of clinical research and receive mentorship to develop an investigative project, the yearlong course will provide participants with the skills necessary to design research initiatives, ethically direct research teams, successfully communicate ideas with data analysts, and write and submit scientific articles. Additionally, the course, articulated in a series of interactive lectures, mentored activities, and workshops, will teach participants to review articles submitted for publication to medical journals and to critically appraise evidence in published research. It is our hope that this initiative will be of interest to junior faculty of academic anesthesiology departments nationally and internationally.","Cavallone Laura F, Duggan Elizabeth W, Berger Jeffrey S",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2022,36274996,PMC9583761,10.46374/volxxiv_issue3_cavallone,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36274996,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9583761,TRUE,"Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course - a yearlong course with interactive lectures, mentored activities, and workshops",Early career academic anesthesiologists who wish to gain competency in clinical research,"Participants will gain skills to design research initiatives, ethically direct research teams, communicate with data analysts, write scientific articles, review journal submissions, and critically appraise evidence",TRUE,"Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course.

Effect of dexmedetomidine on intracranial pressure in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery in Trendelenburg position through ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter.,"To evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery in Trendelenburg position through ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). Ninety patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy were selected as research subjects in this prospective study. These patients were divided into a dexmedetomidine group (n=45) and a control group (n=45) using a random number table. The dexmedetomidine group was pumped with 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine (20041731, Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group, China) 10 min before the anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous pump of 0.5 μg/(kg·h) until the end of the surgery, and the control group was pumped with 0.5 μg/(kg·h) 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Patients in both groups were assisted with mechanical ventilator after endotracheal intubation by rapid induction. Intraoperatively, the pneumoperitoneum pressure was maintained at 14 mmHg, and the bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 60. We recorded ONSD measured with ultrasonography in both groups at 5 min before induction of anesthesia in supine position (T1), 5 min after CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum in Trendelenburg position (T2), 30 min after CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum in Trendelenburg position (T3), 60 min after CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum in Trendelenburg position (T4) and 5 min after the close of pneumoperitoneum in supine position (T5). The cerebral oxygen metabolism indicators of the two groups at different time periods were compared, including jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO<sub>2</sub>), arterial content and arterial-to-internal jugular difference (Da-jvO<sub>2</sub>), cerebral oxygen extraction rate (CERO<sub>2</sub>). Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were also recorded at T1-T5. Besides, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, time of endotracheal extubation, recovery time for orientation and postoperative adverse reactions were recorded in each group. There were significant differences in ONSD at T2 ((4.77±0.14) mm vs. (4.98±0.13) mm), T3 ((5.19±0.15) mm vs. (5.53±0.14) mm), T4 ((5.10±0.11) mm vs. (5.27±0.13) mm) and T5 ((4.71±0.12) mm vs. (4.4±0.16) mm) between the two groups (all P<0.05), and obvious differences were also found within groups when comparing the ONSD at T2-T5 to that at T1 (P<0.05). There were also significant differences in SjvO<sub>2</sub>, Da-jvO<sub>2</sub> and CERO<sub>2</sub> between the control group and the dexmedetomidine group at T2-T5 (all P<0.05), and obvious differences were found within groups when comparing the indices at T2-T5 to those at T1 (P<0.05). The incidences of postoperative dizziness (20.00%), nausea and vomiting (17.78%), and headache (13.33%) in the dexmedetomidine group and were significantly lower than those in the control group (55.56%, 48.89% and 42.22%, respectively; all P<0.05). At T2-T5, dexmedetomidine group had lower HR than control group (P<0.05), while no differences were found in MAP between the two groups (P>0.05). There were also no differences in ASA grade, time of endotracheal extubation, and recovery time for orientation between the two groups (both P>0.05). Dexmedetomidine can effectively decrease the occurence of increased ICP in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery in Trendelenburg position, improve brain oxygen metabolism, and reduce the incidences of postoperative dizziness, nausea and vomiting as well as headache (China Clinical Trials Registration Center, registration number: ChiCTR2100052046, https://www.chictr.org.cn).","Zhu Ting, Yuan Chen, Qian Meijuan, Zhao Lihong, Li Hui, Xie Yang",American journal of translational research,2022,36247291,PMC9556444,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36247291,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9556444,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Greater tau pathology is associated with altered predictive coding.,"Altered predictive coding may underlie the reduced auditory mismatch negativity amplitude observed in patients with dementia. We hypothesized that accumulating dementia-associated pathologies, including amyloid and tau, lead to disturbed predictions of our sensory environment. This would manifest as increased reliance on 'observed' sensory information with an associated increase in feedforward, and decrease in feedback, signalling. To test this hypothesis, we studied a cross-sectional cohort of participants who underwent PET imaging and high-density EEG during an oddball paradigm, and used dynamic casual modelling and Bayesian statistics to make inferences about the neuronal architectures (generators) and mechanisms (effective connectivity) underlying the observed auditory-evoked responses. Amyloid-β imaging with [C-11] Pittsburgh Compound-B PET was qualitatively rated using established criteria. Tau-positive PET scans, with [F-18]MK-6240, were defined by an MK-6240 standardized uptake value ratio positivity threshold at 2 standard deviations above the mean of the Amyloid(-) group in the entorhinal cortex (entorhinal MK-6240 standardized uptake value ratio > 1.27). The cross-sectional cohort included a total of 56 participants [9 and 13 participants in the Tau(+) and Amyloid(+) subgroups, respectively: age interquartile range of (73.50-75.34) and (70.5-75.34) years, 56 and 69% females, respectively; 46 and 43 participants in the Tau(-) and Amyloid(-) subgroups, respectively: age interquartile range of (62.72-72.5) and (62.64-72.48) years, 67 and 65% females, respectively]. Mismatch negativity amplitudes were significantly smaller in Tau+ subgroup than Tau- subgroup (cluster statistics corrected for multiple comparisons: <i>P</i> = 0.028). Dynamic causal modelling showed that tau pathology was associated with increased feedforward connectivity and decreased feedback connectivity, with increased excitability of superior temporal gyrus but not inferior frontal regions. This effect on superior temporal gyrus was consistent with the distribution of tau disease on PET in these participants, indicating that the observed differences in mismatch negativity reflect pathological changes evolving in preclinical dementia. Exclusion of participants with diagnosed mild cognitive impairment or dementia did not affect the results. These observational data provide proof of concept that abnormalities in predictive coding may be detected in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease. This framework also provides a construct to understand how progressive impairments lead to loss of orientation to the sensory world in dementia. Based on our modelling results, plus animal models indicating that Alzheimer's disease pathologies produce hyperexcitability of higher cortical regions through local disinhibition, mismatch negativity might be a useful monitor to deploy as strategies that target interneuron dysfunction are developed.","Gjini Klevest, Casey Cameron, Tanabe Sean, Bo Amber, Parker Margaret, White Marissa, Kunkel David, Lennertz Richard, Pearce Robert A, Betthauser Tobey, Christian Bradley T, Johnson Sterling C, Bendlin Barbara B, Sanders Robert D",Brain communications,2022,36226138,PMC9547525,10.1093/braincomms/fcac209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36226138,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9547525,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Leveraging existing education innovations to establish a community of practice to promote medical education scholar development.,"While some academic health centers have organizational structures to support educational scholarship, such as Medical Education Research Units (MERU), many education scholars may lack access to such institutional resources to support their research agenda and professional growth. In 2014, as part of an externally funded education grant, three faculty educators established a unique education data management system Research & Evaluation Data for Educational Improvement (REDEI). Lacking an institutional MERU, they established an educational research community of practice (CoP) using REDEI as the research dataset. The senior faculty member's effort to facilitate the group is funded by the Dean's Office. The CoP meets every 2 weeks to generate research ideas, discuss analytic approach and strategy, review analyses designed to address or explore a research question, and plans for manuscript development. Our CoP has grown from 3 to 18 members representing faculty educators, administrators, and staff across many departments in the School of Medicine. As of 2021, the REDEI system contains performance data on 1,246 students across all years of undergraduate medical education. To date, we have published 11 peer-reviewed educational research manuscripts. Five learners have served as coauthors (three medical students and two residents), three of whom were first authors. Eleven additional papers are in process. This community of practice supports productivity, provides mentorship, overcomes barriers, and is flexible enough for people to join when they can or when an area of interest is actively under development. We are working on educational interdisciplinary research grant submission and creating collaborations with other institutions. Our focus remains on honing skills in grantsmanship, identification of impactful research questions, application of rigorous methods and instrumentation to address them, and refining process of budget development, timelines, and other planning strategies.","Jones R Logan, Miller Juve Amy, Hasan Reem, Shuford Alexandra, Carney Patricia A",Medical education online,2022,36217945,PMC9559469,10.1080/10872981.2022.2133587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36217945,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9559469,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effect of table inclination angle on videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy: Operator's muscle activation and laryngeal exposure analysis.,"Optimal vocal cord visualization depends on the patient's anatomical factors, characteristics of the laryngoscope, and the operator's muscle action. This study evaluated the effect of table inclination and three different laryngoscopic methods on procedural variables. The primary aim of this study is to compare differences in laryngoscopic view among clinicians based on the instrument used and table orientation. The secondary aim is to determine differences in upper extremity muscle activity based on laryngoscope use and table inclination. Fifty-five anesthesia providers with different experience levels performed intubations on a manikin using three angles of table inclination and three laryngoscopy methods. Time to intubation, use of optimization maneuvers, glottic view, operator's comfort level, and upper extremity muscle activation measured by surface electromyography were evaluated. Table inclination of 15° and 30° significantly reduced intubation time and the need for optimization maneuvers. Fifteen degrees inclination gave the highest comfort level. Anterior deltoid muscle intensity was decreased when table inclination at 15° and 30° was compared to a flat position. Table inclination of 15° reduces intubation time and the need to use optimization maneuvers and is associated with higher operator's comfort levels than 0° and 30° inclination in a simulated scenario using a manikin. Different upper extremity muscle groups are activated during laryngoscopy, with the anterior deltoid muscle exhibiting significantly higher activation levels with direct laryngoscopy at zero-degree table inclination.","Riveros-Perez Efrain, Bolgla Lori, Yang Nianlan, Avella-Molano Bibiana, Albo Camila, Rocuts Alexander",BMC anesthesiology,2022,36192677,PMC9528055,10.1186/s12871-022-01849-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36192677,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9528055,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Peripheral interleukin-6-associated microglial QUIN elevation in basolateral amygdala contributed to cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of postoperative delirium.,"Developing effective approaches for postoperative delirium has been hampered due to the lack of a pathophysiologically similar animal model to offer insights into the pathogenesis. The study, therefore, aimed to develop a delirium-like mouse model and explore the underlying mechanism. The three cycles of 10-min clamp following 5-min reopening of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were performed in adult male C57BL/6 mice to induce a delirium-like phenotype. Composite Z score calculated based on the results of Open Field, Y Maze and Buried Food Tests was employed to assess the delirium phenotype in mice. Microglia activities were monitored by immunofluorescence staining and comprehensive morphological analysis. Systemic administration of minocycline (MINO), IL-6 antibody or IL-6 neutralizing antibody, was applied to manipulate microglia. The expressions of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) were examined by RT-PCR and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry, respectively. Cytokines were measured using fluorescence activated cell sorting method. The repeated ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) surgery caused significant anxiety (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and cognition decline in working memory and orientation (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in mice at postoperative 24 h. The composite Z score, indicating an overall disturbance of brain function, fluctuated over 24 h after I/R surgery (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Immunofluorescent staining showed that the percentage of microglia in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<i>P</i> < 0.05) was reactivated after I/R surgery and was negatively correlated with dwell time at Y maze (<i>R</i> = -0.759, <i>P</i> = 0.035). Inhibiting microglia activities by MINO reduced QUIN productions (<i>P</i> < 0.01) that improved cognitive deficits (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The peripheral IL-6 might cause IL-6 elevation in the BLA. Systemic administration of IL-6 antibodies suppressed I/R-induced IL-6 elevations (<i>P</i> < 0.05), microglial reactivations (<i>P</i> < 0.05), IDO-1 expressions (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and neuroactive metabolite QUIN productions (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in the BLA, resulting in a recovery of cognitive deficits (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Injection of IL-6 exerted opposite effects. The repeated intestinal I/R surgery-induced mouse model is a simple and reproducible one of postoperative delirium. Peripheral IL-6-associated microglial QUIN elevations in the BLA contributed to cognitive dysfunction in the model of postoperative delirium.","Mu Jing-Lan, Liu Xiao-Dong, Dong Ye-Hong, Fang Ying-Ying, Qiu Shi-Da, Zhang Fu, Liu Ke-Xuan",Frontiers in medicine,2022,36160165,PMC9500157,10.3389/fmed.2022.998397,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36160165,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9500157,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effect of dexmedetomidine on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in older patients undergoing pulmonary surgery.,"We investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine anesthesia on postoperative cognitive function after pulmonary surgery. A blinded, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed on 60 patients (age range 65-74 years) undergoing lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (29 in the dexmedetomidine group; 31 in the placebo group). Dexmedetomidine group patients received dexmedetomidine, and placebo group patients received an equal volume of physiological saline 20 minutes before anesthesia induction. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 1 day before surgery and on postoperative day (POD)1, POD3, and POD7. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy before anesthesia. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was significantly different between the two groups on POD1 (dexmedetomidine 26.4  ±  0.73 <i>vs</i>. placebo 25.5 ± 0.96) and POD3 (dexmedetomidine 27.1 ± 0.79 <i>vs</i>. placebo 26.6 ± 0.80). Specifically, attention and orientation scores were increased in the dexmedetomidine group on POD1 and POD3. The rSO<sub>2</sub> was not significantly different between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups. Dexmedetomidine given before induction of anesthesia could reduce the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and might not decrease rSO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, dexmedetomidine could be employed in pulmonary surgical procedures, especially for older patients with a high risk of cognitive dysfunction.","Liu Tao, Liu Fang-Chao, Xia Yu, Luo Tai-Jun, Wang Fei, Chen Bin, Wang Chun, Gao Guang-Kuo, Zhai Wen-Ting, Liu Wei",The Journal of international medical research,2022,36151758,PMC9513575,10.1177/03000605221123680,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36151758,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9513575,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Description and Outcome of Severe Hypoglycemic Encephalopathy in the Intensive Care Unit.,"Disorders of consciousness due to severe hypoglycemia are rare but challenging to treat. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to describe our multimodal neurological assessment of patients with hypoglycemic encephalopathy hospitalized in the intensive care unit and their neurological outcomes. Consecutive patients with disorders of consciousness related to hypoglycemia admitted for neuroprognostication from 2010 to 2020 were included. Multimodal neurological assessment included electroencephalography, somatosensory and cognitive event-related potentials, and morphological and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with quantification of fractional anisotropy. Neurological outcomes at 28 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after hypoglycemia were retrieved. Twenty patients were included. After 2 years, 75% of patients had died, 5% remained in a permanent vegetative state, 10% were in a minimally conscious state, and 10% were conscious but with severe disabilities (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended scores 3 and 4). All patients showed pathologic electroencephalography findings with heterogenous patterns. Morphological brain MRI revealed abnormalities in 95% of patients, with various localizations including cortical atrophy in 65% of patients. When performed, quantitative MRI showed decreased fractional anisotropy affecting widespread white matter tracts in all patients. The overall prognosis of patients with severe hypoglycemic encephalopathy was poor, with only a small fraction of patients who slowly improved after intensive care unit discharge. Of note, patients who did not improve during the first 6 months did not recover consciousness. This study suggests that a multimodal approach capitalizing on advanced brain imaging and bedside electrophysiology techniques could improve diagnostic and prognostic performance in severe hypoglycemic encephalopathy.","Sangare Aude, Marois Clémence, Perlbarg Vincent, Pyatigorskaya Nadya, Valente Mélanie, Zyss Julie, Borden Alaina, Lambrecq Virginie, Le Guennec Loic, Sitt Jacobo, Weiss Nicolas, Rohaut Benjamin, Demeret Sophie, Puybasset Louis, Demoule Alexandre, Naccache Lionel",Neurocritical care,2023,36109449,,10.1007/s12028-022-01594-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36109449,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Call to Action: A Specialty-Specific Course to Support the Next Generation of Clinician Scientists in Anesthesiology.,"Clinical production pressure is a significant problem for faculty of anesthesiology departments who seek to remain involved in research. Lack of protected time to dedicate to research and insufficient external funding add to this long-standing issue. Recent trends in funding to the departments of anesthesiology and their academic output validate these concerns. A 2022 study examining National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant recipients associated with anesthesiology departments across 10 years (2011-2020) outlines total awarded funds at $1,676,482,440, with most of the funds awarded to only 10 departments in the United States. Of note, the total 1-year NIH funding in 2021 for academic internal medicine departments was 3 times higher than the 10-year funding of anesthesiology departments. Additionally, American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) diplomats represent a minority (37%) of the anesthesiology researchers obtaining grant funding, with a small number of faculty members receiving a prevalence of monies. Overall, the number of publications per academic anesthesiologist across the United States remains modest as does the impact of the scholarly work. Improving environments in which academic anesthesiologists thrive may be paramount to successful academic productivity. In fact, adding to the lack of academic time is the limited bandwidth of senior academic physicians to mentor and support aspiring physician scientists. Given then the challenges for individual departments and notable successes of specialty-specific collaborative efforts (eg, Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research [FAER]), additional pooled-resource approaches may be necessary to successfully support and develop clinician scientists. It is in this spirit that the leadership of Anesthesia & Analgesia and The Journal of Education in Perioperative Medicine, unified with the Association of University Anesthesiologists, aim to sponsor the Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course. Directed toward early career academic anesthesiologists who wish to gain competency specifically in the fundamentals of clinical research and receive mentorship to develop an investigative project, the yearlong course will provide participants with the skills necessary to design research initiatives, ethically direct research teams, successfully communicate ideas with data analysts, and write and submit scientific articles. Additionally, the course, articulated in a series of interactive lectures, mentored activities, and workshops, will teach participants to review articles submitted for publication to medical journals and to critically appraise evidence in published research. It is our hope that this initiative will be of interest to junior faculty of academic anesthesiology departments nationally and internationally.","Cavallone Laura F, Duggan Elizabeth W, Berger Jeffrey S",Anesthesia and analgesia,2022,36108188,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36108188,,TRUE,"Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course - a yearlong course with interactive lectures, mentored activities, and workshops",Early career academic anesthesiologists who wish to gain competency in clinical research,"Participants will gain skills to design research initiatives, ethically direct research teams, communicate with data analysts, write scientific articles, review journal submissions, and critically appraise evidence",TRUE,"Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course.

"Effect of the arterial needle bevel position on puncture pain and postremoval bleeding time in hemodialysis patients: A self-controlled, single-blind study.","This study aimed to investigate the effect of the bevel orientation (facing upwards or downwards towards the skin) of the needle inserted into the arterial limb of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) on puncture pain and postremoval bleeding time. This study, using a single-blind crossover design, was conducted on 35 maintenance hemodialysis patients who had been dialyzed for at least 6 months and in whom blood access was via an AVF. AVF cannulation was performed with the needle bevel pointing upward in the first six sessions and the needle bevel pointing downwards (towards the skin) in the subsequent six sessions. Needles were always inserted in the direction of blood flow. At each dialysis session, cannulation pain was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), and the bleeding time at the end of dialysis after needle removal was recorded. The VAS score and postremoval bleeding time were lower when the needle bevel pointed downwards towards the skin during insertion (P < 0.05). Insertion of the needle with the bevel pointed downward decreased puncture pain during cannulation and bleeding time postdialysis on needle removal.","Ozen Nurten, Tosun Betul, Sayilan Aylin Aydin, Eyileten Tayfun, Ozen Volkan, Ecder Tevfik, Tosun Nuran",Hemodialysis international.

Gender and Racial Disparity Among Liver Transplantation Professionals: Report of a Global Survey.,"Equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are fundamental principles. Little is known about the pattern of practice and perceptions of EDI among liver transplant (LT) providers. International Liver Transplant Society (ILTS) EDI Committee survey around topics related to discrimination, mentorship, and gender. Answers were collected and analyzed anonymously. Worldwide female leadership was also queried via publicly available data. The survey was e-mailed to 1312 ILTS members, 199 responses (40.7% female) were collected from 38 countries (15.2% response rate). Almost half were surgeons (45.7%), 27.6% hepatologists and 26.6% anesthetists. Among 856 LT programs worldwide, 8.2% of leadership positions were held by females, and 22% of division chiefs were female across all specialties. Sixty-eight of respondents (34.7%) reported some form of discrimination during training or at their current position, presumably related to gender/sexual orientation (20.6%), race/country of origin (25.2%) and others (7.1%). Less than half (43.7%) received mentorship when discrimination occurred. An association between female responses and discrimination, differences in compensation, and job promotion was observed.

"Implementing surgical mentorship in a resource-constrained context: a mixed methods assessment of the experiences of mentees, mentors, and leaders, and lessons learned.","A well-qualified workforce is critical to effective functioning of health systems and populations; however, skill gaps present a challenge in low-resource settings. While an emerging body of evidence suggests that mentorship can improve quality, access, and systems in African health settings by building the capacity of health providers, less is known about its implementation in surgery. We studied a novel surgical mentorship intervention as part of a safe surgery intervention (Safe Surgery 2020) in five rural Ethiopian facilities to understand factors affecting implementation of surgical mentorship in resource-constrained settings. We designed a convergent mixed-methods study to understand the experiences of mentees, mentors, hospital leaders, and external stakeholders with the mentorship intervention. Quantitative data was collected through a survey (n = 25) and qualitative data through in-depth interviews (n = 26) in 2018 to gather information on (1) intervention characteristics including areas of mentorship, mentee-mentor relationships, and mentor characteristics, (2) organizational context including facilitators and barriers to implementation, (3) perceived impact, and (4) respondent characteristics. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data using frequency analysis and the constant comparison method, respectively; we integrated findings to identify themes. All mentees (100%) experienced the intervention as positive. Participants perceived impact as: safer and more frequent surgical procedures, collegial bonds between mentees and mentors, empowerment among mentees, and a culture of continuous learning. Over 70% of all mentees reported their confidence and job satisfaction increased. Supportive intervention characteristics included a systems focus, psychologically safe mentee-mentor relationships, and mentor characteristics including generosity with time and knowledge, understanding of local context, and interpersonal skills. Supportive organizational context included a receptive implementation climate. Intervention challenges included insufficient clinical training, inadequate mentor support, and inadequate dose. Organizational context challenges included resource constraints and a lack of common understanding of the intervention. We offer lessons for intervention designers, policy makers, and practitioners about optimizing surgical mentorship interventions in resource-constrained settings. We attribute the intervention's success to its holistic approach, a receptive climate, and effective mentee-mentor relationships. These qualities, along with policy support and adapting the intervention through user feedback are important for successful implementation.","Alidina Shehnaz, Sydlowski Meaghan M, Ahearn Olivia, Andualem Bizuayehu G, Barash David, Bari Sehrish, Barringer Erin, Bekele Abebe, Beyene Andualem D, Burssa Daniel G, Derbew Miliard, Drown Laura, Gulilat Dereje, Gultie Teruwork K, Hayirli Tuna C, Meara John G, Staffa Steven J, Workineh Samson E, Zanial Noor, Zeleke Zebenay B, Mengistu Abraham E, Ashengo Tigistu A",BMC medical education,2022,36045356,PMC9434847,10.1186/s12909-022-03691-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36045356,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9434847,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Maintaining Medical Student Motivation During Remote Clinical Learning.,"Remote clinical learning (RCL) may result in learner disengagement. The factors that influence medical student motivation during RCL remain poorly understood. The authors aimed to explore factors that affect medical student motivation during RCL and determine potential strategies to optimize student motivation during RCL. In December 2020, the authors conducted semistructured interviews with third- and fourth-year medical students at the University of California, San Francisco, who had experienced RCL. The authors coded transcripts and conducted an inductive thematic analysis using self-determination theory (SDT), which describes autonomy, competence, and relatedness as essential for motivation, as a sensitizing framework. Twelve students were interviewed. Four themes were identified and aligned with SDT: balancing flexibility and structure (autonomy), selecting appropriate resources (competence), setting reasonable expectations (competence), and building and maintaining community (relatedness). Students described a sense of tension between desiring flexibility and appreciating structure and accountability during RCL; a preference for high-yield, curated resources presented in an organized format during RCL; instances in which the remote curriculum fell short of their expectations or professional goals or in which they felt they had missed out on key clinical learning; and support sought from peers, mentors, and instructors during RCL, as well as the contribution of remote learning technology to a sense of community. The authors propose 4 guiding principles to address implementation of remote clinical curricula: provide students with choice within the bounds of a well-defined curriculum, curate and organize learning materials carefully and intentionally, orient students to the goals and objectives of the curriculum and discuss students' expectations for professional development, and incorporate structured opportunities for remote mentorship and peer-peer interaction and optimize these opportunities using technology. Educators can draw on the themes, guiding principles, and potential strategies identified to promote and maintain learner motivation during RCL.","Charondo Leslie Bernal, Duque Jackeline Barajas, Kirsch Heidi E, Brondfield Sam",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2023,36044278,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36044278,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

"Efficacy and safety of subanesthetic doses of esketamine combined with propofol in painless gastrointestinal endoscopy: a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","Painless gastrointestinal endoscopy is widely used for the diagnosis and treatment of digestive diseases. At present, propofol is commonly used to perform painless gastrointestinal endoscopy, but the high dose of propofol often leads to a higher incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory complications. Studies have shown that the application of propofol combined with ketamine in painless gastrointestinal endoscopy is beneficial to reduce the dosage of propofol and the incidence of related complications. Esketamine is dextrorotatory structure of ketamine with a twice as great anesthetic effect as normal ketamine but fewer side effects. We hypothesized that esketamine may reduce the consumption of propofol and to investigate the safety of coadministration during gastrointestinal endoscopy. A total of 260 patients undergoing painless gastrointestinal endoscopy (gastroscope and colonoscopy) were randomly divided into P group (propofol + saline), PK1 group (propofol + esketamine 0.05 mg/kg), PK2 group (propofol + esketamine 0.1 mg/kg), and PK3 group (propofol + esketamine 0.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was achieved by 1.5 mg/kg propofol with different doses of esketamine. Propofol consumption per minute was recorded. Hemodynamic index, pulse oxygen saturation, operative time, induction time, awakening status, orientation recovery time, adverse events, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were also recorded during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Propofol consumption per minute was 11.78, 10.56, 10.14, and 9.57 (mg/min) in groups P, PK1, PK2, and PK3, respectively; compared with group P, groups PK2 and PK3 showed a decrease of 13.92% (P = 0.021) and 18.76% (P = 0.000), respectively. In all four groups, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), but not pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) significantly decreased (P = 0.000) immediately after administration of induction, but there were no significant differences between the groups. The induction time of groups P, PK1, PK2, and PK3 was 68.52 ± 18.394, 64.83 ± 13.543, 62.23 ± 15.197, and 61.35 ± 14.470 s, respectively (P = 0.041). Adverse events and psychotomimetic effects were observed but without significant differences between the groups. The combination of 0.2 mg/kg esketamine and propofol was effective and safe in painless gastrointestinal endoscopy as evidenced by less propofol consumption per minute, shorter induction time, and lower incidence of cough and body movement relative to propofol alone. The lack of significant differences in hemodynamic results, anesthesia-related indices, adverse events, and MMSE results showed the safety to apply this combination for painless gastrointestinal endoscopy.

YAP1 alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury <i>via</i> inhibiting ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis is a phospholipid peroxidation-mediated and iron-dependent cell death form, involved in sepsis-induced organ injury and other lung diseases. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, could target multiple ferroptosis regulators. Herein, this study aimed to explore the involvement of ferroptosis in the etiopathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and demonstrate that YAP1 could disrupt ferritinophagy and moderate sepsis-induced ALI. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models were constructed in wild-type (WT) and pulmonary epithelium-conditional knockout (YAP1<sup>f/f</sup>) mice to induce ALI, while MLE-12 cells with or without YAP1 overexpression were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In-vivo</i> modes showed that YAP1 knockout aggravated CLP-induced ALI and also accelerated pulmonary ferroptosis, as presented by the downregulated expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11, along with the upregulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Transcriptome research identified these key genes and ferroptosis pathways involved in sepsis-induced ALI. <i>In-vitro</i> modes consistently verified that YAP1 deficiency boosted the ferrous iron accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to LPS. Furthermore, the co-IP assay revealed that YAP1 overexpression could prevent the degradation of ferritin to a mass of Fe<sup>2+</sup> (ferritinophagy) <i>via</i> disrupting the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, which blocked the transport of cytoplasmic Fe<sup>2+</sup> into the mitochondria <i>via</i> the mitochondrial membrane protein (SFXN1), further reducing the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, these findings revealed that YAP1 could inhibit ferroptosis in a ferritinophagy-mediated manner, thus alleviating sepsis-induced ALI, which may provide a new approach to the therapeutic orientation for sepsis-induced ALI.","Zhang Jing, Zheng Yongping, Wang Yun, Wang Jin, Sang Aming, Song Xuemin, Li Xinyi",Frontiers in immunology,2022,35979359,PMC9376389,10.3389/fimmu.2022.884362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35979359,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9376389,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Postoperative Recovery Outcomes for Obese Patients Undergoing General Anesthesia: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"This study was performed to assess the postoperative recovery outcomes in obese patients undergoing general anesthesia. The eligible studies were identified from PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane library until December 2020. The standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the role of desflurane, sevoflurane, and propofol on recovery outcomes, and the analyses using the random-effects model. Eleven randomized controlled trials involving 713 obese patients undergoing general anesthesia were selected for final meta-analysis.

RGD Nanoarrays with Nanospacing Gradient Selectively Induce Orientation and Directed Migration of Endothelial and Smooth Muscle Cells.,"Directed migration of cells through cell-surface interactions is a paramount prerequisite in biomaterial-induced tissue regeneration. However, whether and how the nanoscale spatial gradient of adhesion molecules on a material surface can induce directed migration of cells is not sufficiently known. Herein, we employed block copolymer micelle nanolithography to prepare gold nanoarrays with a nanospacing gradient, which were prepared by continuously changing the dipping velocity. Then, a self-assembly monolayer technique was applied to graft arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptides on the nanodots and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the glass background. Since RGD can trigger specific cell adhesion via conjugating with integrin (its receptor in the cell membrane) and PEG can resist protein adsorption and nonspecific cell adhesion, a nanopattern with cell-adhesion contrast and a gradient of RGD nanospacing was eventually prepared. In vitro cell behaviors were examined using endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as a demonstration. We found that SMCs exhibited significant orientation and directed migration along the nanospacing gradient, while ECs exhibited only a weak spontaneously anisotropic migration. The gradient response was also dependent upon the RGD nanospacing ranges, namely, the start and end nanospacings under a given distance and gradient. The different responses of these two cell types to the RGD nanospacing gradient provide new insights for designing cell-selective nanomaterials potentially used in cell screening, wound healing, etc.","He Junhao, Shen Runjia, Liu Qiong, Zheng Shuang, Wang Xinlei, Gao Jingming, Wang Qunsong, Huang Jiale, Ding Jiandong",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,35943249,,10.1021/acsami.2c10006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35943249,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Comparison and Clinical Value of Ciprofol and Propofol in Intraoperative Adverse Reactions, Operation, Resuscitation, and Satisfaction of Patients under Painless Gastroenteroscopy Anesthesia.","To investigate the comparison and clinical value of ciprofol and propofol for painless gastroenteroscopy anesthesia in terms of intraoperative adverse reactions, operation, resuscitation, and satisfaction of patients. A total of 96 patients who underwent painless gastroenteroscopy anesthesia in our hospital from June 2021 to January 2022 were enrolled. The cases were randomly assigned into research group and control group. The control group received propofol anesthesia (<i>n</i> = 49), and the research group received ciprofol anesthesia (<i>n</i> = 47). The patients, physician satisfaction, vital signs, incidence of adverse reactions, anesthetic first dose, additional time, additional dose, total dose, induction time, insertion time, operation time, awake time, orientation recovery time, leaving room time, and injection pain score were compared. The overall satisfaction of the study group was higher than that of the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). After taking medicine, the score of 1 min and MAP in the study group were higher than those in the control group. The incidence of adverse reactions in the study group was lower than that in the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The satisfaction of doctors in the study group was higher than that in the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The anesthesia induction time, intubation time, operation time, awake time, orientation recovery time, and leaving room time in the study group were significantly longer than those in the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The incidence and degree of injection pain in the propofol group were significantly lower than those in the propofol group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In painless gastroenteroscopy, compared with propofol, ciprofol is equally safe and effective for patients and will not cause early cognitive dysfunction after operation, which is a good choice in painless gastroenteroscopy anesthesia. In addition, ciprofol has significant advantages in patient and physician satisfaction, especially in injection pain.

Anesthesia Effect of Remifentanil Combined with Propofol in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and Its Impact on Postoperative Cognitive Recovery.,"To investigate the anesthesia effect of remifentanil combined with propofol for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and its impact on postoperative cognitive recovery. A total of 120 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our hospital from February 2019 to June 2021 were recruited and assigned into either control group or experimental group at a ratio of 1 : 1 via the random number table method. The patients in the control group were anesthetized with fentanyl combined with propofol, and the patients in the experimental group were anesthetized with remifentanil combined with propofol. The clinical basic indicators (extubation time, recovery time, breathing recovery time, and orientation recovery time), and observer's assessment of awareness/sedation (OAA/S) scores and complications were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in extubation time between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The postoperative wake-up time, respiratory recovery time, and orientation recovery time of the experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group (<i>P</i>  < 0.05). The OAA/S scores of the patients in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group immediately after surgery, 1 h after surgery, and 3 h after surgery (<i>P</i>  < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the OAA/S scores between the two groups on the 1st day after operation (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The incidence of complications in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (<i>P</i>  < 0.05). Remifentanil + propofol for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients has a significant anesthesia effect. This strategy effectively shortens the extubation, awakening, respiratory recovery, orientation recovery time of patients, and OAA/S score, suggest a minor impact on the postoperative cognitive function and state of consciousness. It has a high safety profile and thus is worthy of clinical application.","Jiang Wei, Wang Jun, Ni Xin-Xin, Huang Zu-Chao",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2022,35873649,PMC9307346,10.1155/2022/9147416,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35873649,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9307346,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Utilizing Competence-Based Simulation to Improve Orientation Outcomes.,"New graduate respiratory therapists (RTs), regardless of the degree program, receive limited preparation in neonatal/pediatric diseases and management. Experienced RTs typically have adult knowledge but limited exposure to pediatrics. We developed a program that included competence-based simulation to improve orientation success. A 9-week orientation program curriculum with simulation-based competence assessment was developed to ensure all new hires gained knowledge and skills to perform pediatric clinical tasks. Each new hire individually completed the same simulation scenarios during the first week and last week of orientation. Curriculum changes were made over time based on performance in simulations and on-the-job knowledge and skills during and after orientation. Paired and unpaired <i>t</i> tests were used with <i>P</i> < .05 as significant. From January 2017-February 2020, the program had 3 updates. Noninvasive ventilation and decompensating patient scenarios were completed for all periods. Ninety-two new staff were oriented in period 1 = 29 (new graduate RTs 20, experienced RTs 9); period 2 = 17 (new graduate RTs 10, experienced RTs 7); period 3 = 24 (new graduate RTs 21, experienced RTs 3), and period 4 = 22 (new graduate RTs = 22). Remediation during orientation occurred in 15% of the staff. Seventy-one percent successfully advanced to ICU orientation after completion of the program. All staff improved scores between pre- versus post-simulations in all periods: mean difference ± SD period 1: new graduate RTs 32.0 ± 17.0, <i>P</i> < .001; experienced RTs 28.0 ± 18.9, <i>P</i> < .001; period 2: new graduate RTs 23.0 ± 15.2, <i>P</i> < .001; experienced RTs 29.0 ± 12.1, <i>P</i> < .001; period 3: new graduate RTs 26.0 ± 15.8, <i>P</i> < .001; experienced RTs 27.0 ± 15.1, <i>P</i> = .007; and period 4: new graduate RTs 19.0 ± 14.5, <i>P</i> < .001, paired <i>t</i> test. The scores between new graduate RTs and experienced RTs during post-simulation were not significantly different for period 1 (<i>P</i> = .35) but were significantly different for periods 2-4 (<i>P</i> = .040, unpaired <i>t</i> test).

Clinical Observation of Patients Undergoing Glioma Surgery under Propofol and Sevoflurane Anesthesia: A Retrospective Study.,"To observe the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on patients undergoing glioma surgery. 192 patients with gliomas treated in our hospital from January 2016 to January 2021 were selected. All patients were randomly divided into observation group and control group. The observation group was given sevoflurane and the control group was given propofol. The clinical effects of the two groups were observed. Comparison of clinical indexes related to intraoperative conditions between the two groups revealed that the time of anesthesia and extubation after operation in the observation group were shorter than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The amount of intraoperative bleeding in the observation group was less than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). There was no significant difference in intracranial operation time, operation time, fluid volume, and urine volume between the two groups (P < 05). Comparing the recovery time of anesthesia between the two groups, the recovery time of orientation and the time of eye-opening in the observation group were significantly shorter than those in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Comparing the consciousness and cognitive function of the two groups, the OAAS score of the observation group after extubation, before leaving the operating room and 1 hour after extubation, was significantly higher than that of the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and the MMSE score l h after extubation was significantly higher than that of the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Comparing the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups, the number of cases of restlessness, urinary infection, deep vein thrombosis, and hypertension in the observation group was lower than that in the control group, with statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The anesthesia time and extubation time of the sevoflurane anesthesia group were shorter than that of the propofol anesthesia group, and the orientation recovery time and eye-opening time were shortened. The OAAS score of the sevoflurane anesthesia group was higher than that of the propofol anesthesia group after extubation, before extubation, and 1 hour after extubation. The probability of postoperative complications in the sevoflurane anesthesia group was lower than that in the propofol anesthesia group. Sevoflurane anesthesia may be more suitable for surgical induction of glioma patients than propofol anesthesia.","Fang Junbiao, Wang Hongfa, Zhang Weihua, Yang Kaichuang, Wang Weiyu",Journal of oncology,2022,35720226,PMC9200574,10.1155/2022/4516537,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35720226,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9200574,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Evaluation and Analysis of Fellow Learning and Education Curriculum in a Regional Anesthesiology and Acute Pain Medicine Fellowship: A Prospective, Observational Pilot Study.","Since 2017, several regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellowship programs throughout the country have developed various educational didactic curriculums to address the core medical knowledge requirements as set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Given the paucity of existing literature regarding the medical knowledge acquisition of regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows, this study aimed to determine how quickly these fellows learn during their fellowship year, with a secondary aim of analyzing a new educational didactic curriculum in its goal of delivering the required medical knowledge. An 89-question, multiple-choice examination was administered to the 2020-2021 regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center during orientation and again at 4 months and 8 months into the fellowship. A secondary analysis of anonymous deidentified answers was completed. Fellows averaged 64%, 74%, and 79% correct responses on the orientation, 4-month, and 8-month exams, respectively. An analysis of the orientation exam revealed that the most commonly incorrect answers stemmed from topics including lower extremity nerve blocks, truncal blocks, and neuraxial anesthesia. The 4-month exam showed overall marked improvement; however, truncal blocks remained the most missed topic. Topics with 100% correct response rates in all examinations were local anesthetic pharmacology and systemic opioids. The results of this study indicate that a large portion of learning occurs during the first 4 months of the fellowship and slows thereafter. Using this simple form of fellowship evaluation, changes to an educational didactic curriculum can be implemented to reach medical knowledge goals more effectively and efficiently as required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.","Klosowski Maciej Z, Schott Nicholas J",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2022,35707019,PMC9176400,10.46374/volxxiv_issue1_schott,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35707019,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9176400,TRUE,"Educational didactic curriculum with multiple-choice examinations administered at orientation, 4 months, and 8 months into fellowship",Regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,Effective and efficient delivery of required medical knowledge to meet Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements,TRUE,"An 89-question, multiple-choice examination was administered to the fellows during orientation and again at 4 months and 8 months into the fellowship.

Supporting the Foundation of Nurse Anesthesia Education: A Report of the Faculty Stabilization Taskforce.,"Without highly qualified educators and educational program administrators, the ability to provide anesthesia and pain management services throughout the healthcare system will be threatened by the inadequate supply of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). The average turnover rate between the years 2016-2020, for CRNA program administrators, was 15% with some programs changing leadership as often as every two to four years. In response, the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) and the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs (COA) created the Faculty Stabilization Taskforce (FSTF) to review reasons for the high turnover rate and to develop methods and tools to support program faculty and administrators in their role of educating the future CRNA workforce. The FSTF provided two recommendations: 1) to create a robust faculty development program for all faculty at all levels of CRNA education, and 2) to create a repository of information needed to administrate, and educate students, in a high-quality CRNA program.

"Comparison of desflurane and propofol in the speed and the quality of emergence from anesthesia in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery-a prospective, randomized study.","Anesthesia with desflurane or propofol enables rapid emergence. In patients undergoing lung cancer surgery, however, the speed of emergence from desflurane, but not from propofol, may be affected by the deteriorated postoperative respiratory function.

Eighty patients scheduled for lung cancer surgery were randomly allocated to Desflurane group (Group D) and Propofol group (Group P). Combined general and epidural anesthesia was performed in the identical way except for the anesthetic. There was no significant difference between the groups in the time to awakening, extubation, or orientation. However, emergence agitation (EA) occurred more frequently in Group D than in Group P (20/40 <i>vs.</i> 4/40, P<0.001).

"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Among Anesthesiology Trainees.","Historically in medicine, women and minorities have been underrepresented. This trend is especially significant in the anesthesiology workforce. The goals of this study were to quantify the current state of diversity by race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation among anesthesiology residents. An institutionally reviewed and validated survey was delivered through Qualtrics to 130 anesthesiology program directors. Topics addressed included gender identity, sexual orientation, racial and ethnic background, rationale for pursuing anesthesiology, and medical training experiences. The study was administered from February to April 2021; 135 anesthesiology residents responded to the survey. The sample was 44.4% white (<i>n</i> = 60), 54.1% male (<i>n</i> = 73), and 83.7% (<i>n</i> = 113) of respondents self-reported as straight or heterosexual. Respondents indicated that role models/mentors were somewhat or very important in their desire to pursue anesthesiology (<i>n</i> = 85; 67.2%), 42% reported that having women/diverse faculty was somewhat or very important in their decision to pursue anesthesiology. Discrimination during the anesthesiology residency application process or as a resident ranged from 4.4% due to sexual orientation to 18.7% due to gender/gender identity and race/ethnicity. Experiences of discrimination based on race/ethnicity, gender, and gender identity continues to be a concern among anesthesiology trainees.

Gender Gap: A Qualitative Study of Women and Leadership Acquisition in Anesthesiology.,"The representation of women among leaders in the field of anesthesia continues to trail that of their male counterparts. This qualitative study was conducted to understand the pathway of leadership acquisition among women in the field of anesthesiology. Using constructivist grounded theory, we sought to determine whether there were specific internal or external factors that were common to women in leadership in the specialty field of anesthesiology, and specifically, how they obtained leadership positions. Semistructured interviews were conducted for data collection. A total of 26 women in leadership positions in anesthesiology participated in this study. The analysis of these interviews resulted in the development of 4 common themes related to career pathways for these women in leadership. Each theme was examined in depth to determine the qualities necessary for individuals to advance in the field and the pathway to obtaining leadership positions. The findings of this study showed that early-career, high-value mentorship and sponsorship were important factors in leadership acquisition. Most participants (n = 20; 76%) had early mentors. Of those with early mentorship, 13 (65%) had high-value mentors, who we define as someone with power or authority. Sponsorship was the leading factor contributing to leadership acquisition.

Learning the Language of Medical Device Innovation: A Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Elective for Medical Students.,"Physicians are playing a growing role as clinician-innovators. Academic physicians are well positioned to contribute to the medical device innovation process, yet few medical school curricula provide students opportunities to learn the conceptual framework for clinical needs finding, needs screening, concept generation and iterative prototyping, and intellectual property management. This framework supports innovation and encourages the development of valuable interdisciplinary communication skills and collaborative learning strategies. Our university offers a novel 3-year-long medical student Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Elective in Biodesign (MSLIEB) that teaches medical device innovation in 4 stages: (1) seminars and small-group work, (2) shared clinical experiences for needs finding, (3) concept generation and product development by serving as consultants for biomedical engineering capstone projects, and (4) reflection and mentorship. The MSLIEB objectives are to: create a longitudinal interdisciplinary peer mentorship relationship between undergraduate biomedical engineering students and medical students, and encourage codevelopment of professional identities in relation to medical device innovation. The MSLIEB enrolled 5 entering cohorts from 2017 to 2021 with a total of 37 medical student participants. The first full entering cohort of 12 medical students produced 8 mentored biomedical engineering capstone projects, 7 of which were based on clinical needs statements derived from earlier in the elective. Medical student participants have coauthored poster and oral presentations; contributed to projects that won WolfieTank, a university-wide competition modeled after the television show Shark Tank; and participated in the filing of provisional patents. Students reflecting on the course reported a change in their attitude towards existing medical problems, felt better-equipped to collaboratively design solutions for clinical needs, and considered a potential career path in device design. The MSLIEB will be scaled up by recruiting additional faculty, broadening clinical opportunities to include the outpatient setting, and increasing medical student access to rapid prototyping equipment.","Maloney Lauren M, Hakimi Mathew, Hays Thomas, Adachi Joseph, Chau Annie, Esper Brecken S, Koulouris Vasilios, Kung Preston, Meier Karl R, Schum Ryan S, Sha Sha, Wong Ada, Wu Ariel, Yin Wei, Page Christopher R",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2022,35507458,PMC9474701,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004723,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35507458,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9474701,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Identification of Potential Key circRNAs in Aged Mice With Postoperative Delirium.,"Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common postoperative complication in elderly patients and seriously affects postoperative recovery. The exact mechanism of POD is still unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanism of POD in transcriptional regulation. At present, circRNAs have been proven to play an important role in a variety of mental health and cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. To reveal the effect of circRNA on POD, we used microarray to analyze the differential expression profiles of circRNAs in the hippocampus of 12-month-old mice between the tibial fracture and control groups. A total of 1,4236 circRNAs were identified. Compared with the control group, there were 500 circRNAs with increased expression and 187 with decreased expression. The accuracy of the microarray data was further verified by qRT-PCR. Finally, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that changes in axon orientation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, glutamate synapses, the estrogen signaling pathway, the RAS signaling pathway and other systems may be important potential pathological mechanisms in the progression of POD. In particular, we found that the <i>HOMER1</i> gene and its transcript mmu_circRNA_26701 are specifically expressed in the glutamate synapse, which may provide new clues and intervention targets for the progression of this refractory disease.","Ran Wei, Liang Ning, Yuan Ruixue, Wang Zhiqiao, Gao Jin",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2022,35493320,PMC9047966,10.3389/fnmol.2022.836534,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35493320,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9047966,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Using the Teaching Career Enhancement Award from the American Physiological Society to train faculty to successfully implement flipped teaching.,"Flipped teaching (FT) is a student-centered instructional method that shifts lectures out of the classroom and uses a variety of activities to apply content during class time. FT has gained attention among educators as a student-centered instructional method. However, many faculty still lack the skills, knowledge, confidence, and expertise to implement FT in their classrooms. Therefore, course-specific training and focused mentorship are critical in successfully implementing FT. Four faculty members, from an adjunct professor to a full professor, from four diverse institutions around the country, were recruited and funded through the American Physiological Society's Teaching Career Enhancement Award to receive training in the implementation of FT in their courses. This study aimed to provide specific tools and strategies to engage students in deeper learning through activities in the participants' courses. A course was built using the Blackboard Learning Management System for the participants to receive relevant readings to be completed prior to the FT workshop. Upon completing this training, the participants examined the design and execution of FT in their classrooms and, subsequently, reflected on and refined their future course offerings. The facilitator mentored the participants throughout the process, including an on-site observation of a live FT session. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected before and after their FT experiences. Based on the survey results, this study helped improve the FT knowledge and self-efficacy of all participants.

"An Anatomy-Informed, Novel Technique for S1 Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation Lead Placement.","A heightened and organized understanding of sacral anatomy could potentially lead to a more effective and safe method of dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRG-S) lead placement. The aim of this technical note is to describe a standardized access method for S1 DRG-S lead placement. Technical note. The described approach utilizes alignment of the lumbosacral prominence and is measurement-based, allowing for standardized sacral access, even when visualization is suboptimal. The medial-to-lateral needle trajectory is designed to limit interaction with the sensitive neural structures and allows for a more parallel orientation of the lead to the DRG and nerve root. The described technique potentially improves the safety of S1 DRG-S lead placement. The parallel lead orientation to the DRG may also increase efficacy while lowering energy requirements.","Chapman Kenneth B, van Helmond Noud, Kallewaard Jan Willem, Vissers Kris C, Patel Kiran V, Motivala Soriaya, Hagedorn Jonathan M, Deer Timothy R, Dickerson David M","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2022,35426940,PMC9527614,10.1093/pm/pnac062,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35426940,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9527614,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Sodium Channels and Local Anesthetics-Old Friends With New Perspectives.,"The long history of local anesthetics (LAs) starts out in the late 19th century when the content of coca plant leaves was discovered to alleviate pain. Soon after, cocaine was established and headed off to an infamous career as a substance causing addiction. Today, LAs and related substances-in modified form-are indispensable in our clinical everyday life for pain relief during and after minor and major surgery, and dental practices. In this review, we elucidate on the interaction of modern LAs with their main target, the voltage-gated sodium channel (Navs), in the light of the recently published channel structures. Knowledge of the 3D interaction sites of the drug with the protein will allow to mechanistically substantiate the comprehensive data available on LA gating modification. In the 1970s it was suggested that LAs can enter the channel pore from the lipid phase, which was quite prospective at that time. Today we know from cryo-electron microscopy structures and mutagenesis experiments, that indeed Navs have side fenestrations facing the membrane, which are likely the entrance for LAs to induce tonic block. In this review, we will focus on the effects of LA binding on fast inactivation and use-dependent inhibition in the light of the proposed new allosteric mechanism of fast inactivation. We will elaborate on subtype and species specificity and provide insights into modelling approaches that will help identify the exact molecular binding orientation, access pathways and pharmacokinetics. With this comprehensive overview, we will provide new perspectives in the use of the drug, both clinically and as a tool for basic ion channel research.","Körner Jannis, Albani Simone, Sudha Bhagavath Eswaran Vishal, Roehl Anna B, Rossetti Giulia, Lampert Angelika",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,35418860,PMC8996304,10.3389/fphar.2022.837088,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35418860,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8996304,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Cross-trial prediction of depression remission using problem-solving therapy: A machine learning approach.,"Psychotherapy is a standard depression treatment; however, determining a patient's prognosis with therapy relies on clinical judgment that is subject to trial-and-error and provider variability. To develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict depression remission for patients undergoing 6 months of problem-solving therapy (PST). Using data from the treatment arm of 2 randomized trials, ML models were trained and validated on ENGAGE-2 (ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT03841682) and tested on RAINBOW (ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT02246413) for predictions at baseline and at 2-months. Primary outcome was depression remission using the Depression Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) score < 0.5 at 6 months. Predictor variables included baseline characteristics (sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, psychosocial) and intervention engagement through 2-months. Of the 26 candidate variables, 8 for baseline and 11 for 2-months were predictive of depression remission, and used to train the models. The best-performing model predicted remission with an accuracy significantly greater than chance in internal validation using the ENGAGE-2 cohort, at baseline [72.6% (SD = 3.6%), p < 0.0001] and at 2-months [72.3% (5.1%), p < 0.0001], and in external validation with the RAINBOW cohort at baseline [58.3% (0%), p < 0.0001] and at 2-months [62.3% (0%), p < 0.0001]. Model-agnostic explanations highlighted key predictors of depression remission at the cohort and patient levels, including female sex, lower self-reported sleep disturbance, lower sleep-related impairment, and lower negative problem orientation. ML models using clinical and patient-reported data can predict depression remission for patients undergoing PST, affording opportunities for prospective identification of likely responders, and for developing personalized early treatment optimization along the patient care trajectory.","Kannampallil Thomas, Dai Ruixuan, Lv Nan, Xiao Lan, Lu Chenyang, Ajilore Olusola A, Snowden Mark B, Venditti Elizabeth M, Williams Leanne M, Kringle Emily A, Ma Jun",Journal of affective disorders,2022,35398399,,10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35398399,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Model for establishing a new liver transplantation center through mentorship from a university with transplantation expertise.,"Setting up new liver transplant (LT) centers is essential for countries with organ shortages. However, good outcomes require experience, because LT learning depends on a high number of surgeries. This study aims to describe how a new center was set up from a partnership between the new center and an experienced one. The step-by-step preparation process, the time needed and the results of the new center are depicted. The mentoring process lasted 40 months, in which half of the 52 patients included on the transplant list received LT. After the mentorship, a 22-month period was also analyzed, in which 46 new patients were added to the waiting list and nine were operated on. The 30-day survival rates during (92.3%) and after (66.7%) the partnership were similar to the other LT centers in the same region, as well as the rates of longer periods. The waiting time on the LT list, the characteristics of the donors and the ischemia times did not differ during or after the mentorship. The partnership between universities is a suitable way to set up LT centers, achieving good results for the institutions and the patients involved.","Pinheiro Rafael Soares, Andraus Wellington, Romeiro Fernando Gomes, de Martino Rodrigo Bronze, Ducatti Liliana, Arantes Rubens Macedo, Pelafsky Leonardo, Hasimoto Claudia Nishida, Yamashiro Fabio da Silva, Nacif Lucas Souto, Haddad Luciana Bertocco de Paiva, Santos Vinicius Rocha, Waisberg Daniel Reis, Vane Matheus Fachini, Rocha-Filho Joel Avancini, de Oliveira Walmar Kerche, Carneiro-D'Albuquerque Luiz Augusto",PloS one,2022,35353873,PMC8967004,10.1371/journal.pone.0266361,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35353873,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8967004,TRUE,Mentorship partnership between an experienced liver transplantation center and a new center,Healthcare professionals at a new liver transplantation center,Successful establishment of a new liver transplantation center with good patient outcomes comparable to other centers in the region,FALSE,,,
3D bioprinting of a gelatin-alginate hydrogel for tissue-engineered hair follicle regeneration.,"Hair follicle (HF) regeneration remains challenging, principally due to the absence of a platform that can successfully generate the microenvironmental cues of hair neogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a 3D bioprinting technique based on a gelatin/alginate hydrogel (GAH) to construct a multilayer composite scaffold simulating the HF microenvironment in vivo. Fibroblasts (FBs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dermal papilla cells (DPCs), and epidermal cells (EPCs) were encapsulated in GAH (prepared from a mixture of gelatin and alginate) and respectively 3D-bioprinted into the different layers of a composite scaffold. The bioprinted scaffold with epidermis- and dermis-like structure was subsequently transplanted into full-thickness wounds in nude mice. The multilayer scaffold demonstrated suitable cytocompatibility and increased the proliferation ability of DPCs (1.2-fold; P < 0.05). It also facilitated the formation of self-aggregating DPC spheroids and restored DPC genes associated with hair induction (ALP, β-catenin, and α-SMA). The dermal and epidermal cells self-assembled successfully into immature HFs in vitro. HFs were regenerated in the appropriate orientation in vivo, which can mainly be attributed to the hierarchical grid structure of the scaffold and the dot bioprinting of DPCs. Our 3D printed scaffolds provide a suitable microenvironment for DPCs to regenerate entire HFs and could make a significant contribution in the medical management of hair loss. This method may also have broader applications in skin tissue (and appendage) engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hair loss remains a challenging clinical problem that influences quality of life. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has become a useful tool for the fabrication of tissue constructs for transplantation and other biomedical applications. In this study, we used a 3D bioprinting technique based on a gelatin/alginate hydrogel to construct a multi-layer composite scaffold with cuticular and corium layers to simulate the microenvironment of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in the human body. This new approach permits the controllable formation of self-aggregating spheroids of DPCs in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix and the initiation of epidermal-mesenchymal interactions, which results in HF formation in vivo. The ability to regenerate entire HFs should have a significant impact on the medical management of hair loss.","Kang Deni, Liu Zhen, Qian Chuanmu, Huang Junfei, Zhou Yi, Mao Xiaoyan, Qu Qian, Liu Bingcheng, Wang Jin, Hu Zhiqi, Miao Yong",Acta biomaterialia,2023,35288311,,10.1016/j.actbio.2022.03.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35288311,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Remote Patient-Monitoring System for Intensive Care Medicine: Mixed Methods Human-Centered Design and Usability Evaluation.,"Continuous monitoring of vital signs is critical for ensuring patient safety in intensive care units (ICUs) and is becoming increasingly relevant in general wards. The effectiveness of health information technologies such as patient-monitoring systems is highly determined by usability, the lack of which can ultimately compromise patient safety. Usability problems can be identified and prevented by involving users (ie, clinicians). In this study, we aim to apply a human-centered design approach to evaluate the usability of a remote patient-monitoring system user interface (UI) in the ICU context and conceptualize and evaluate design changes. Following institutional review board approval (EA1/031/18), a formative evaluation of the monitoring UI was performed. Simulated use tests with think-aloud protocols were conducted with ICU staff (n=5), and the resulting qualitative data were analyzed using a deductive analytic approach. On the basis of the identified usability problems, we conceptualized informed design changes and applied them to develop an improved prototype of the monitoring UI. Comparing the UIs, we evaluated perceived usability using the System Usability Scale, performance efficiency with the normative path deviation, and effectiveness by measuring the task completion rate (n=5). Measures were tested for statistical significance using a 2-sample t test, Poisson regression with a generalized linear mixed-effects model, and the N-1 chi-square test. P<.05 were considered significant. We found 37 individual usability problems specific to monitoring UI, which could be assigned to six subcodes: usefulness of the system, response time, responsiveness, meaning of labels, function of UI elements, and navigation. Among user ideas and requirements for the UI were high usability, customizability, and the provision of audible alarm notifications. Changes in graphics and design were proposed to allow for better navigation, information retrieval, and spatial orientation. The UI was revised by creating a prototype with a more responsive design and changes regarding labeling and UI elements. Statistical analysis showed that perceived usability improved significantly (System Usability Scale design A: mean 68.5, SD 11.26, n=5; design B: mean 89, SD 4.87, n=5; P=.003), as did performance efficiency (normative path deviation design A: mean 8.8, SD 5.26, n=5; design B: mean 3.2, SD 3.03, n=5; P=.001), and effectiveness (design A: 18 trials, failed 7, 39% times, passed 11, 61% times; design B: 20 trials, failed 0 times, passed 20 times; P=.002). Usability testing with think-aloud protocols led to a patient-monitoring UI with significantly improved usability, performance, and effectiveness. In the ICU work environment, difficult-to-use technology may result in detrimental outcomes for staff and patients. Technical devices should be designed to support efficient and effective work processes. Our results suggest that this can be achieved by applying basic human-centered design methods and principles.

Perception Precedes Reality: A Simulation and Procedural Bootcamp Improves Residents' Comfort With Transitioning to Clinical Anesthesiology Training.,"Background The transition from internship to clinical anesthesiology (CA) training is often difficult given the differences in workflow, procedures, environment, and clinical situations. The primary aims of this study were to determine if a standardized introductory bootcamp could improve clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level of new anesthesiology residents in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems. The secondary aim of the study was to see if a standardized bootcamp could be replicated at other programs. Methods The introduction to anesthesiology resident bootcamp was developed at one institution in 2015 then expanded to a second program in 2019. The bootcamp was a one-day experience consisting of simulation and task trainers that all rising first-year CA residents (CA-1) participated in during their first month of anesthesiology training. All participating residents were given a survey immediately before and after the bootcamp. The average ratings of the questions were calculated and used as the primary measure. The Anesthesia Knowledge Test (AKT) was used as a surrogate measure of participant knowledge. Results From 2015 to 2020, a total of 105 residents completed the pre-survey and 109 completed the post-survey across the two sites. The improvement in average rating was significant (Pre: 2.04±0.46 versus Post: 3.09±0.52 p<0.0001). Individual item analysis also showed significant improvement on all of the eight items (p<0.0001). Analyses by site revealed the same results at both average score and item level. There was no significant cohort difference in either AKT-0 (Control: 57.84±26.86 versus Intervention 50.13±25.14, p=0.14) or AKT-1 (Control: 41.06±26.42 versus Intervention 41.70±26.60, p=0.90) percentile scores. Conclusions Incorporation of an introduction to anesthesia bootcamp for new residents significantly improves participant comfort level and is reproducible across institutions. However, it does not improve resident performance on standardized tests.","Kazior Michael R, Chen Fei, Isaak Robert, Dhandha Vishal, Cobb Kathryn W",Cureus,2022,35242473,PMC8883744,10.7759/cureus.21706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35242473,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8883744,TRUE,One-day bootcamp consisting of simulation and task trainers for new anesthesiology residents,Rising first-year clinical anesthesiology residents (CA-1),Improved clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems,TRUE,A one-day bootcamp experience consisting of simulation and task trainers,New anesthesiology residents in their first month of anesthesiology training,Improvement in clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems
Reinvigorating an Academy of Medical Educators Using Ecological Systems Theory.,"The educational framework of communities of practice postulates that early learners join medical communities as social networks that provide a common identity, role modeling and mentorship, and experiential learning. While being elected into a medical society is an honor, member engagement in these groups can falter if the society membership is seen as an honorific rather than one requiring continuing participation. As an example, Academies of Medical Educators have been established by many academic medical centers to encourage collaboration, skill development, professional identity formation, and scholarship. The University of North Carolina established the Academy of Educators in 2006 to create a diverse community of educators to promote the scholarship, teaching skills, and professional identity of educators. Despite rapid growth to over 500 members, we had less than 30 participants at events over the 2017-2018 academic year. To increase member engagement and participation, our academy leadership team used Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory to design interventions at each layer of environmental influence, specifically at the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem levels. In this paper, we describe the multipronged approach used to increase the University of North Carolina Academy of Medical Educators event attendance from 30 to 1,000 faculty participants over the course of one academic year (2018-2019). This paper provides a model as to how medical societies can use ecological systems theory as a natural and comprehensive approach to plan and improve their member engagement and experience.","Zwemer Eric, Chen Fei, Beck Dallaghan Gary L, Shenvi Christina, Wilson Lindsay, Martinelli Susan M, Resnick-Kahle Morgran, Crowner Jason, Joyner Benny L, Westervelt Lauren, Jordan Joanne M, Chuang Alice, Shaheen Amy",Cureus,2022,35233317,PMC8881048,10.7759/cureus.21640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35233317,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881048,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Initiation of an Emulsion Microinfusion: Flow Direction Influences Delivery Onset Rate.,"Critically ill and anesthetized patients commonly receive life-sustaining medications by pump-driven continuous intravenous infusion. Microinfusion refers to delivering concentrated drugs with low flow carriers to conserve fluid administration. Most infused medications are water-soluble. Delivery onset lag times have been identified for microinfusions of water-soluble drugs or experimental surrogates. Drugs may be formulated as emulsions. Initiation of emulsion microinfusions has not been described. We tested in vitro the hypothesis that an emulsion's physical characteristics would influence its microinfusion delivery onset. We adapted an established in vitro model of pump-driven continuous intravenous microinfusion to compare the delivery of methylene blue as a surrogate for water-soluble drugs and a 10% lipid emulsion as a surrogate for a drug formulated as an emulsion. The drug surrogates joined the carrier with carrier flow vertically upwards, vertically downwards or horizontally. We measured the times to 5%, 50% and 95% of plateau delivery. Emulsion entry into a vertical (upwards) carrier flow resulted in a rapid initial emulsion delivery exceeding predictions of delivery models. Emulsion entry into both horizontal and vertical (downwards) carrier flows resulted in long lag times to steady state. Methylene blue delivery was unaffected by carrier flow orientation. Initiating microinfusion emulsion delivery with upward flow can result in a relative bolus, whereas long delivery lags would be expected with horizontal or downwards flow. An emulsion might carry a high potency drug having significant physiologic effects, e. g. clevidipine. Unrecognized, differences in initial emulsion delivery kinetics depending on carrier flow orientation may have clinical implications for both efficacy and safety.","Tsao Amy C, Parker Michael J, Lovich Mark A, Suja Vineeth Chandran, Deng Hao, Houle Timothy, Peterfreund Robert A",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2022,35227840,,10.1016/j.ejps.2022.106154,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35227840,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Advice for doctors working or planning to work in intensive care: summation from a qualitative study.,"Healthcare personnel who work for prolonged periods in highly stressful environments are susceptible to the effects of these stressors and the cumulative nature of their exposure. The term 'burnout' has been coined to describe a constellation of symptoms related to work, organisational and personal issues occurring in individuals with no prior history [1]. Burnout has been described as particularly prevalent in the critical care setting [2-4]; it affects not only the health and wellbeing of those individuals experiencing the deleterious consequences, but also the quality of the care they provide [1]. There is significant literature that supports the worthiness of mentorship [5-7] throughout medical training. Following on from our paper exploring the behavioural responses of intensivists to stressors encountered working in the intensive care environment [8], the aim of this study was to elicit the advice senior intensivists might offer others on dealing with the stresses of a career in intensive care.","Dennis Diane, Knott Cameron, Khanna Rahul, van Heerden Peter Vernon",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,2022,35193328,PMC10156479,10.5114/ait.2022.113278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35193328,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10156479,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A novel Fontan Y-graft for interrupted inferior vena cava and azygos continuation.,"To evaluate the hemodynamicdynamic advantage of a new Fontan surgical template that is intended for complex single-ventricle patients with interrupted inferior vena cava-azygos and hemi-azygos continuation. The new technique has emerged from a comprehensive pre-surgical simulation campaign conducted to facilitate a balanced hepatic flow and somatic Fontan pathway growth after Kawashima procedure. For 9 patients, aged 2 to18 years, majority having poor preoperative oxygen saturation, a pre-surgical computational fluid dynamics customization is conducted. Both the traditional Fontan pathways and the proposed novel Y-graft templates are considered. Numerical model was validated against in vivo phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging data and in vitro experiments. The proposed template is selected and executed for 6 out of the 9 patients based on its predicted superior hemodynamic performance. Pre-surgical simulations performed for this cohort indicated that flow from the hepatic veins (HEP) do not reach to the desired lung. The novel Y-graft template, customized via a right- or left-sided displacement of the total cavopulmonary connection anastomosis location resulted a drastic increase in HEP flow to the desired lung. Orientation of HEP to azygos direct shunt is found to be important as it can alter the flow pattern from 38% in the caudally located direct shunt to 3% in the cranial configuration with significantly reversed flow. The postoperative measurements prove that oxygen saturation increased significantly (P-value = 0.00009) to normal levels in 1 year follow-up. The new Y-graft template, if customized for the individual patient, is a viable alternative to the traditional surgical pathways. This template addresses the competing hemodynamic design factors of low physiological venous pressure, high postoperative oxygen saturation, low energy loss and balanced hepatic growth factor distribution possibly assuring adequate lung development. 25 October 2019, 280011928-604.01.01.","Lashkarinia S Samaneh, Cicek Murat, Kose Banu, Rezaeimoghaddam Mohammad, Yılmaz Emine Hekim, Aydemir Numan Ali, Rasooli Reza, Ozkok Sercin, Yurtseven Nurgul, Erdem Hasan, Pekkan Kerem, Sasmazel Ahmet",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,2022,35134949,PMC9159461,10.1093/icvts/ivac001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35134949,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9159461,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Application of Different Doses of Dexmedetomidine Combined with General Anesthesia in Anesthesia of Patients with Traumatic Tibiofibular Fractures and Its Effect on the Incidence of Adverse Reactions.,"To explore the application of different doses of dexmedetomidine combined with general anesthesia in patients with traumatic tibiofibular fractures. A total of 120 patients with traumatic tibiofibular fractures treated in our hospital (January 2018-January 2021) were selected as the research subjects and equally grouped into group A, group B, group C, and group D according to the dosage of dexmedetomidine. Group B, group C, and group D were pumped with 0.3 <i>μ</i>g/kg, 0.5 <i>μ</i>g/kg, and 0.8 <i>μ</i>g/kg load doses of dexmedetomidine before anesthesia induction, with the same doses for maintenance during surgery. Group A was intravenously pumped with the same amount of normal saline and received tracheal intubation after anesthesia induction, with propofol and remifentanil to maintain general anesthesia during surgery. No notable differences in general data were observed among the groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Ramsay sedation scores of all groups showed a downward trend after drug withdrawal. At 10 min, 30 min, and 60 min, the scores of groups <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> were markedly higher than those of groups A and B (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and the scores were higher in group D than those in group C (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The HR changes at each period were close between groups A and B (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The HRs at T1 and T2 in group C were slightly lower than those in group D (<i>P</i> > 0.05), and the HRs at T1 in groups A and B were remarkably higher than those in groups C and D, and were higher than those at T0 and T2 (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The SBP levels of all groups began to rise at T0, peaked at T1, and decreased to a lower level at T2 than that at T0. Moreover, the SBP levels of groups C and D at T1 and T2 were notably lower compared with groups A and B (<i>P</i> < 0.05). With a lower DBP level in group C than the other three groups at T1, the DBP levels were notably lower in groups C and D than those in groups A and B at T2 (<i>P</i> < 0.05). With no statistical difference in the MAP levels at T0 among the four groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05), the MAP levels in group A at T1 and T2 were obviously higher compared with groups C and D (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The extubation time in group A was notably longer than that that in groups B, C, and D (<i>P</i> < 0.05), with longer extubation time in group B than that in groups C and D (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The orientation recovery time in group D was markedly shorter than that in groups A, B, and C (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The incidence of cognitive dysfunction, chills, and restlessness in groups C and D was notably lower compared with groups A and B (<i>P</i> < 0.05), with a higher incidence of chills, intraoperative hypotension, and delayed awakening in group D than in group C (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Dexmedetomidine at doses of 0.5 <i>μ</i>g/kg and 0.8 <i>μ</i>g/kg has a better effect in the maintenance of general anesthesia for patients with traumatic tibiofibular fractures, with faster orientation recovery, better recovery of postoperative cognitive function, and a lower incidence of adverse reactions. Dexmedetomidine at 0.5 <i>μ</i>g/kg is recommended in view of the increased risk of excessive sedation, chills, restlessness, and intraoperative hypotension in patients at 0.8 <i>μ</i>g/kg.","Zhang Jizheng, Sun Xiaohua, Cheng Wenjie, Ren Wanlu",Journal of healthcare engineering,2021,34950440,PMC8692005,10.1155/2021/3080098,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950440,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8692005,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Association between Prehospital Hypoxemia and Admission to Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The aim of this study was to assess the association between prehospital peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We carried out a retrospective cohort study on patients requiring prehospital intervention between 11 March 2020 and 4 May 2020. All adult patients in whom a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was suspected by the prehospital physician were included. Patients who presented a prehospital confounding respiratory diagnosis and those who were not eligible for ICU admission were excluded. The main exposure was ""Low SpO<sub>2</sub>"" defined as a value < 90%. The primary outcome was 48-h ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were 48-h mortality and 30-day mortality. We analyzed the association between low SpO<sub>2</sub> and ICU admission or mortality with univariable and multivariable regression models. <i>Results</i>: A total of 145 patients were included. A total of 41 (28.3%) patients had a low prehospital SpO<sub>2</sub> and 21 (14.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU during the first 48 h. Low SpO<sub>2</sub> was associated with an increase in ICU admission (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2-10.0), which remained significant after adjusting for sex and age (aOR = 5.2, 95% CI = 1.8-15.4). Mortality was higher in low SpO<sub>2</sub> patients at 48 h (OR = 7.1 95% CI 1.3-38.3) and at 30 days (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-10.7). <i>Conclusions</i>: In our physician-staffed prehospital system, first low prehospital SpO<sub>2</sub> values were associated with a higher risk of ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Midez Rémy, Fehlmann Christophe A, Marti Christophe, Larribau Robert, Rouyer Frédéric, Boroli Filippo, Suppan Laurent, Gartner Birgit Andrea","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2021,34946307,PMC8707267,10.3390/medicina57121362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946307,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8707267,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

However, little is known about the influence of VSA for surgical novices on VR-simulator training regarding the complexity of different tasks over a long-term training period. Our study evaluated prior VSA and VSA development in surgical trainees during VR-simulator training, and its influence on surgical performance in simulator training. In our single-center prospective two-arm randomized trial, VSA was measured with a tube figure test before curriculum training. After 1:1 randomization, the training group (TG) participated in the entire curriculum training consisting of 48 different VR-simulator tasks with varying difficulty over a continuous nine-day training session. The control group (CG) performed two of these tasks on day 1 and 9. Correlation and regression analyses were used to assess the influence of VSA on VR-related surgical skills and to measure procedural abilities. Sixty students (33 women) were included. Significant improvements in the TG in surgical performance and faster completion times were observed from days 1 to 9 for the scope orientation 30° right-handed (SOR), and cholecystectomy dissection tasks after the structured 9-day training program. After training, the TG with pre-existing low VSA scores achieved performance levels similar to those with pre-existing high VSA scores for the two VR simulator tasks. Significant correlations between VSA and surgical performance on complex laparoscopic camera navigation SOR tasks were found before training. Our study revealed that that all trainees improved their surgical skills irrespective of previous VSA during structured VR simulator training. An increase in VSA resulted in improvements in surgical performance and training progress, which was more distinct in complex simulator tasks. Further, we demonstrated a positive relationship between VSA and surgical performance of the TG, especially at the beginning of training. Our results identified pre-existing levels of VSA as a predictor of surgical performance.","Sommer Guillermo Marcos, Broschewitz Johannes, Huppert Sabine, Sommer Christina Gesine, Jahn Nora, Jansen-Winkeln Boris, Gockel Ines, Hau Hans-Michael",Medicine,2021,34918632,PMC8677906,10.1097/MD.0000000000027844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918632,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8677906,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Practice variability with syringe labelling practices among anaesthesia residents.,"Practice variability is associated with human error and adverse drug events. We sought to describe the practice variability that exists with drug labelling among a cohort of anaesthesia residents in an academic medical centre. In a controlled, lecture-style environment, residents were instructed to prepare a syringe of atracurium. Label location (longitudinal vs. circumferential), orientation (right hand vs. left hand), compliance, and legibility were assessed. A total of 32 syringes with 48 labels were analysed, of which 11 (34%) had a single longitudinally placed label, 6 (19%) had a single circumferential label, and 15 (47%) had both longitudinally and circumferentially placed labels. Of syringes with longitudinally placed labels, 17 (63%) were placed in the right-hand orientation, 9 (33%) in the left-hand orientation, and 1 (4%) had 2 labels placed in both orientations. Of the syringes with circumferentially placed labels, 17 (81%) were placed in the right-hand orientation and 4 (19%) in the left-hand orientation. Overall compliance with longitudinal and circumferential labels was 95.6% and 43.8%, respectively. Overall legibility with longitudinal and circumferential labels was 90.7% and 90.5%, respectively. A great deal of practice variability with syringe labelling among anaesthesia residents was observed, with significant non-compliance of circumferentially placed labels, which could play a role in increasing the risk of drug errors.","Chen Wei, Drzymalski Dan",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,2021,34902962,PMC10172938,10.5114/ait.2021.110424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902962,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10172938,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
An Annotated Bibliography of Key Studies in Medical Education in 2020: Applying the Current Literature to Educational Practice and Scholarship.,"Pediatric medical educators, with their multitude of responsibilities, may have difficulty staying abreast with both medical education and specialty specific medical literature. The body of medical literature is growing at an exponential rate. This annotated bibliography serves as a summary of highlighted medical education literature in the year 2020. The purpose was to identify manuscripts which have the potential to significantly influence a pediatric medical educator's practice. The authors reviewed abstracts from 14 medical education and specialty journals using a two-staged review process. Each stage of review was completed by 2 different authors. A total of 1861 abstracts were reviewed and ultimately 15 key manuscripts were identified. The authors grouped the manuscripts into 6 core domains: diversity and inclusion, faculty development, feedback, learner development, mentorship, and teaching skills. Condensed summaries of each medical education manuscript likely to influence educational practice are provided by the authors in this annotated bibliography.","Huber Jody N, Lockspeiser Tai M, D'Alessandro Donna M, Wolbrink Traci A, Ryan Michael S, Fromme H Barrett, Potisek Nicholas M",Academic pediatrics,2022,34896270,,10.1016/j.acap.2021.12.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896270,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Strategy of harvesting extended thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps for resurfacing the large soft-tissue defects of extremities.,"The authors presented their strategy to harvest extended thoracodorsal artery (TDA) perforator flaps for resurfacing the large soft-tissue defects of extremities. Thirty-three free extended TDA perforator flaps were harvested in 33 patients. The mean flap size was 145.2 cm<sup>2</sup>. The maximal flap length and the width were 30 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The color Doppler sonography (CDS) was used for preoperative assessment of perforators. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) was used for intraoperative assessment of flap viability in three patients. The vascular thrombosis, donor-site scar widening, and delayed recipient-site wound healing were not significantly related to the patient and flap characteristics. Flap tip or partial necrosis was significantly related to age and peripheral vascular disease. True positive rate, false negative rate, and positive predictive value of CDS for perforator identification were not different significantly between attending surgeon and residents. In the distance discrepancy of CDS, significant difference was found based on the classifications of perforator size, perforator type, and sonographic operator. The ICGA identified a hypoperfused distal area in a 30 cm long flap. The CDS locates the TDA perforators more precisely when scanned by experienced hands, in larger size or septocutaneous perforators. Using reliable and more perforators, applying muscle-sparing technique, considering suprafascial course of perforator and proper flap orientation are helpful in harvesting extended TDA perforator flaps. ICGA is an option for assessing flap viability, especially in elders and patients with peripheral vascular diseases.","Lin Cheng-Ta, Wu Su-Zhen, Chen Lee-Wei","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",2022,34896047,,10.1016/j.bjps.2021.11.035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896047,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Retrospective study of the prevalence of factors contributing to successful standing at first attempt in horses recovering from general anesthesia.,"Several factors affect the quality of recovery from general anesthesia in horses. These can increase the likelihood of injury. Body and limb position during recovery may correlate with successful standing. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of and the factors associated with successful standing at the first attempt in horses undergoing general anesthesia. Retrospective study. Video of recovery and anesthetic records from 221 equine patients were reviewed by six veterinary students. Cases with poor video quality or incomplete anesthetic records were excluded. Demographic variables, type of procedure, perioperative drugs administered, assistance during recovery and body and limb positions during the first attempt to stand were recorded. Association between putative variables (including specific descriptors for body and limb position) and success for standing were analyzed using backward logistic regression; significance was set at 0.05. A decision tree for a successful attempt was created to predict the outcome of a recovery attempt based on these variables. Extension of the carpal joints, head and neck alignment with the thoracic limbs, greater time in lateral recumbency, coordination during sternal recumbency, longer time to first attempt to stand and pelvic limb position were associated with successful standing at the first attempt. The association between extension of the carpal joints with wide base positioning of the pelvic limbs provided the best success rate for standing, whereas the association of flexed carpal joints and head and neck orientation different from the thoracic limbs resulted in a worse success rate. Results suggest that certain limb and body positions displayed by horses during recovery may be associated with the likelihood of successful standing at the first attempt. These variables may be useful for assessing recovery quality in future research.","de Miguel Garcia Cristina, Campoy Luis, Parry Stephen A, Martin-Flores Manuel, Gleed Robin D",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,2022,34893433,,10.1016/j.vaa.2021.10.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893433,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Technology Support Challenges and Recommendations for Adapting an Evidence-Based Exercise Program for Remote Delivery to Older Adults: Exploratory Mixed Methods Study.,"Tele-exercise has emerged as a means for older adults to participate in group exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about the technology support needs of older adults for accessing tele-exercise. This study aims to examine the needs of older adults for transition to tele-exercise, identify barriers to and facilitators of tele-exercise uptake and continued participation, and describe technology support challenges and successes encountered by older adults starting tele-exercise. We used an exploratory, sequential mixed methods study design. Participants were older adults with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (N=44) who started participating in a remotely delivered program called Enhance Fitness. Before the start of the classes, a subsample of the participants (n=10) completed semistructured phone interviews about their technology support needs and the barriers to and facilitators for technology adoption. All of the participants completed the surveys including the Senior Technology Acceptance Model scale and a technology needs assessment. The study team recorded the technology challenges encountered and the attendance rates for 48 sessions delivered over 16 weeks. Four themes emerged from the interviews: participants desire features in a tele-exercise program that foster accountability, direct access to helpful people who can troubleshoot and provide guidance with technology is important, opportunities to participate in high-value activities motivate willingness to persevere through the technology concerns, and belief in the ability to learn new things supersedes technology-related frustration. Among the participants in the tele-exercise classes (mean age 74, SD 6.3 years; 38/44, 86% female; mean 2.5, SD 0.9 chronic conditions), 71% (31/44) had a computer with a webcam, but 41% (18/44) had little or no experience with videoconferencing. The initial technology orientation sessions lasted on average 19.3 (SD 10.3) minutes, and 24% (11/44) required a follow-up assistance call. During the first 2 weeks of tele-exercise, 47% of participants (21/44) required technical assistance, which decreased to 12% (5/44) during weeks 3 to 16. The median attendance was 100% for the first 6 sessions and 93% for the subsequent 42 sessions. With appropriate support, older adults can successfully participate in tele-exercise. Recommendations include individualized technology orientation sessions, experiential learning, and availability of standby technical assistance, particularly during the first 2 weeks of classes. Continued development of best practices in this area may allow previously hard-to-reach populations of older adults to participate in health-enhancing, evidence-based exercise programs.","Gell Nancy, Hoffman Elise, Patel Kushang",JMIR aging,2021,34889743,PMC8704113,10.2196/27645,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889743,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8704113,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Deep learning for anatomical interpretation of video bronchoscopy images.,"Anesthesiologists commonly use video bronchoscopy to facilitate intubation or confirm the location of the endotracheal tube; however, depth and orientation in the bronchial tree can often be confused because anesthesiologists cannot trace the airway from the oropharynx when it is performed using an endotracheal tube. Moreover, the decubitus position is often used in certain surgeries. Although it occurs rarely, the misinterpretation of tube location can cause accidental extubation or endobronchial intubation, which can lead to hyperinflation. Thus, video bronchoscopy with a decision supporting system using artificial intelligence would be useful in the anesthesiologic process. In this study, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model robust to rotation and covering using video bronchoscopy images. We collected video bronchoscopic images from an institutional database. Collected images were automatically labeled by an optical character recognition engine as the carina and left/right main bronchus. Except 180 images for the evaluation dataset, 80% were randomly allocated to the training dataset. The remaining images were assigned to the validation and test datasets in a 7:3 ratio. Random image rotation and circular cropping were applied. Ten kinds of pretrained models with < 25 million parameters were trained on the training and validation datasets. The model showing the best prediction accuracy for the test dataset was selected as the final model. Six human experts reviewed the evaluation dataset for the inference of anatomical locations to compare its performance with that of the final model. In the experiments, 8688 images were prepared and assigned to the evaluation (180), training (6806), validation (1191), and test (511) datasets. The EfficientNetB1 model showed the highest accuracy (0.86) and was selected as the final model. For the evaluation dataset, the final model showed better performance (accuracy, 0.84) than almost all human experts (0.38, 0.44, 0.51, 0.68, and 0.63), and only the most-experienced pulmonologist showed performance comparable (0.82) with that of the final model. The performance of human experts was generally proportional to their experiences. The performance difference between anesthesiologists and pulmonologists was marked in discrimination of the right main bronchus. Using bronchoscopic images, our model could distinguish anatomical locations among the carina and both main bronchi under random rotation and covering. The performance was comparable with that of the most-experienced human expert. This model can be a basis for designing a clinical decision support system with video bronchoscopy.","Yoo Ji Young, Kang Se Yoon, Park Jong Sun, Cho Young-Jae, Park Sung Yong, Yoon Ho Il, Park Sang Jun, Jeong Han-Gil, Kim Tackeun",Scientific reports,2021,34887497,PMC8660867,10.1038/s41598-021-03219-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887497,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8660867,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Job Satisfaction and Performance Orientation of Paramedics in German Emergency Medical Services-A Nationwide Survey.,"(1) Background: Shortage of skilled workers is a relevant global health care problem. To remain competitive with other professions, job satisfaction is a critical issue; however, to date, there are no data available on the German EMS. This study aims to perform a statistical analysis of job satisfaction and performance orientation and to identify risk factors for low job satisfaction of paramedics in the German EMS. (2) Methods: Data were collected from 2590 paramedics through a nationwide cross-sectional survey, using the job satisfaction questionnaire by Neuberger and Allerbeck and the performance orientation questionnaire by Hippler and Krüger. Descriptive and regression statistical analysis were performed. (3) Results: The participants scored significantly lower than the reference sample on job satisfaction, with ""organization and management"" and ""payment"" being the lowest rated subscales. Around 9% of employees feared losing their jobs. While work attitude toward performance and success enhancement was high, fear of failure was also common. (4) Conclusions: Job satisfaction of paramedics in the German EMS is below that of the reference sample. Discontent with payment and organizational issues is common. Performance orientation is high, but fear of failure is frequent. Current and future efforts that aim at an attractive working environment should reflect on these findings.","Eiche Christian, Birkholz Torsten, Konrad Fabian, Golditz Tobias, Keunecke Johann Georg, Prottengeier Johannes",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021,34886189,PMC8656590,10.3390/ijerph182312459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886189,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8656590,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Guiding, Intermediating, Facilitating, and Teaching (GIFT): A Conceptual Framework for Simulation Educator Roles in Healthcare Debriefing.","Use of frameworks for simulation debriefing represents best practice, although available frameworks provide only general guidance. Debriefers may experience difficulties implementing broad recommendations, especially in challenging debriefing situations that require more specific strategies. This study describes how debriefers approach challenges in postsimulation debriefing. Ten experienced simulation educators participated in 3 simulated debriefings. Think-aloud interviews before and after the simulations were used to explore roles that debriefers adopted and the associated strategies they used to achieve specific goals. All data were audio recorded and transcribed, and a constructivist grounded theory approach was used for analysis. 4 roles in debriefing were identified: guiding, (inter)mediating, facilitating integration, and teaching. Each role was associated with specific goals and strategies that were adopted to achieve these goals. The goal of creating and maintaining a psychologically safe learning environment was common across all roles. These findings were conceptualized as the GIFT debriefing framework. Our findings highlight the multiple roles debriefers play and how these roles are enacted in postsimulation debriefing. These results may inform future professional development and mentorship programs for debriefing in both simulation-based education and healthcare settings.","Roze des Ordons Amanda L, Eppich Walter, Lockyer Jocelyn, Wilkie Ryan D, Grant Vincent, Cheng Adam",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,2022,34839303,,10.1097/SIH.0000000000000619,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34839303,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,GIFT debriefing framework,simulation educators,inform future professional development and mentorship programs for debriefing in both simulation-based education and healthcare settings
"Analgesic characteristics of a newly developed α<sub>2</sub>δ ligand, mirogabalin, on inflammatory pain.","Mirogabalin is a novel α<sub>2</sub>δ ligand approved in Japan for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, the sites of action of α<sub>2</sub>δ ligands to produce analgesic effects on inflammatory pain remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the analgesic effect and site of action of mirogabalin using the rat formalin test, an acute inflammatory pain model. Mirogabalin was administered orally, intrathecally, and intracerebroventricularly. Open field tests were performed to evaluate the effect of oral-, intrathecally, and intracerebroventricularly administered mirogabalin on locomotor activity and orientation ability. Oral mirogabalin produced an analgesic effect when the formalin test was performed 4 h, but not 1 or 2 h, after oral administration. Intrathecal, but not intracerebroventricular, administration of mirogabalin produced analgesic effects when mirogabalin was administered 10 min before formalin injection. These analgesic effects were not antagonized by idazoxan, an α2 adrenergic antagonist; WAY100135, a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> antagonist; or naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist. Mirogabalin attenuated moving distances 1 and 2 h after oral administration and 10 min after intracerebroventricular administration, but not 10 min after intrathecal administration. In the oral administration group, the time course of the analgesic effect was different from that of moving distance. In the intracerebroventricular group, mirogabalin attenuated moving distances but did not produce an analgesic effect. In the intrathecal group, mirogabalin produced an analgesic effect but did not affect moving distances. These findings suggest that the analgesic effect of mirogabalin on the rat formalin test is mediated by spinal action and not by the activation of α2, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, or opioid receptors, and that the inhibitory effect of mirogabalin on moving distances is mediated by the supraspinal brain.","Komatsu Shuji, Nakamura Shingo, Nonaka Takahiro, Yamada Toshihiko, Yamamoto Tatsuo",Molecular pain,2021,34823399,PMC8649095,10.1177/17448069211052167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34823399,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8649095,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group.,"The past two decades have witnessed a surge in the use of cervical spine joint procedures including joint injections, nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablation to treat chronic neck pain, yet many aspects of the procedures remain controversial. In August 2020, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the American Academy of Pain Medicine approved and charged the Cervical Joint Working Group to develop neck pain guidelines. Eighteen stakeholder societies were identified, and formal request-for-participation and member nomination letters were sent to those organizations. Participating entities selected panel members and an ad hoc steering committee selected preliminary questions, which were then revised by the full committee. Each question was assigned to a module composed of 4-5 members, who worked with the Subcommittee Lead and the Committee Chairs on preliminary versions, which were sent to the full committee after revisions.

Cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation may provide benefit to well-selected individuals, with medial branch blocks being more predictive than intra-articular injections.

Screening for subjective cognitive decline in the elderly via subjective cognitive complaints and informant-reported questionnaires: a systematic review.,"Subjective cognitive decline may represent at-risk persons progressing to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can be exacerbated by effects of anesthesia and surgery. The objective of this systematic review is to identify the most common questions in subjective cognitive complaint and informant-reported questionnaires used in assessing cognitive impairment of elderly patients that are correlated with standardized tests for cognitive impairment screening. We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database, Emcare Nursing, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, and ICTRP between September 20, 2005 to August 31, 2020. We included studies that evaluated subjective cognitive complaints and informant-reported questions in elderly patients. A total of 28,407 patients were included from 22 studies that assessed 21 subjective complaint questionnaires and nine informant-reported questionnaires. The most common subjective cognitive complaints were those assessing anterograde memory, closely followed by perceptual-motor function and executive function. The most common informant-reported questions were those assessing executive function, temporal orientation, and anterograde memory. Questions assessing learning and memory were most associated with results from standardized tests assessing cognitive impairment. Assessing learning and memory plays a key role in evaluating subjective cognitive decline in elderly patients. Delivering subjective cognitive complaints questions to elderly patient preoperatively may aid in screening for those exhibiting cognitive signs, and in turn are at risk of postoperative complications. Thus, the results from this review contribute to knowledge for healthcare professionals regarding the use of subjective cognitive complaints and informant-reported complaints in preoperative settings.","Wasef Sara, Laksono Isabelle, Kapoor Paras, Tang-Wei David, Gold David, Saripella Aparna, Riazi Sheila, Islam Sazzadul, Englesakis Marina, Wong Jean, Chung Frances",BMC anesthesiology,2021,34753428,PMC8579566,10.1186/s12871-021-01493-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34753428,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8579566,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Evaluation of a quality improvement bundle aimed to reduce opioid prescriptions after Cesarean delivery: an interrupted time series study.,"To evaluate whether opioid prescriptions at discharge after Cesarean delivery decreased following implementation of a quality improvement bundle. A quality improvement bundle was instituted at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Interventions included opioid prescribing instructions in resident orientation, nursing and patient education, and standard electronic prescriptions. We used an interrupted time series study design and included patients who had a Cesarean delivery six months pre intervention and six months post intervention. Primary outcome data (opioids prescribed at discharge in morphine milliequivalents [MME]), were aggregated (averaged) by calendar week and analyzed using interrupted time series. Secondary outcomes were assessed using bivariate methods and included opioid use for breakthrough pain in hospital, and amount of opioids prescribed by prescriber specialty and training level. We included 2,578 women in our analysis.

"A qualitative evaluation of an operational research course for acute care trainees in Kigali, Rwanda.","the blended SORT-IT model uses a combination of online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors to teach operational research. We modified SORT-IT to create the Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course directed to anesthesiology residents in Kigali, Rwanda. This course takes students from an initial research idea through submitting a paper for publication. Our viewpoint on entering this study was that ACOR participants would have adequate resources to complete the course, but be hampered by cultural unfamiliarity with the blended teaching approach. we conducted a qualitative analysis of the experiences of all those who participated in the ACOR course to understand obstacles and improve future course iterations. Six anesthesiology residents participated in the first iteration of the course, with 4 local mentors and 2 secondary mentors, one of whom was based at the University of Virginia, with a total of 12 participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants and mentors, which were independently coded for topics by two reviewers. there was a 50% publication rate for those enrolled in the course and an expected 100% acceptance rate for those who completed the course. Some reported benefits to the course included improved research knowledge, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange. Some reported obstacles to successful course completion included time limitations, background knowledge, and communication. Of note, only 4 out of 12 participants recognized cultural barriers. although successful in the sense that all participants completed their research project, ACOR did not fully solve the main issues hindering research training. Our results show that research training in low-resource settings needs a continuing and formal focus on the factors that hinder participants´ success: mentorship and time.","Wang Tiffany, Barter Shannon, Durieux Marcel, Flickinger Tabor, Twagirumugabe Theogene, Banguti Paulin",The Pan African medical journal,2021,34733389,PMC8531958,10.11604/pamj.2021.40.21.29191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34733389,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8531958,TRUE,Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course - a modified SORT-IT model using blended learning with online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors,"Anesthesiology residents in Kigali, Rwanda","Completion of research projects, improved research knowledge, publication of papers, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange",TRUE,The blended SORT-IT model uses a combination of online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors to teach operational research.

Pain Action Unit Detection in Critically Ill Patients.,"Existing pain assessment methods in the intensive care unit rely on patient self-report or visual observation by nurses. Patient self-report is subjective and can suffer from poor recall. In the case of non-verbal patients, behavioral pain assessment methods provide limited granularity, are subjective, and put additional burden on already overworked staff. Previous studies have shown the feasibility of autonomous pain expression assessment by detecting Facial Action Units (AUs). However, previous approaches for detecting facial pain AUs are historically limited to controlled environments. In this study, for the first time, we collected and annotated a pain-related AU dataset, <i>Pain-ICU</i>, containing 55,085 images from critically ill adult patients. We evaluated the performance of OpenFace, an open-source facial behavior analysis tool, and the trained AU R-CNN model on our <i>Pain-ICU</i> dataset. Variables such as assisted breathing devices, environmental lighting, and patient orientation with respect to the camera make AU detection harder than with controlled settings. Although OpenFace has shown state-of-the-art results in general purpose AU detection tasks, it could not accurately detect AUs in our <i>Pain-ICU</i> dataset (F1-score 0.42). To address this problem, we trained the AU R-CNN model on our <i>Pain-ICU</i> dataset, resulting in a satisfactory average F1-score 0.77. In this study, we show the feasibility of detecting facial pain AUs in uncontrolled ICU settings.","Nerella Subhash, Cupka Julie, Ruppert Matthew, Tighe Patrick, Bihorac Azra, Rashidi Parisa",Proceedings : Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference.

The Association between Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction and Cerebral Oximetry during Geriatric Orthopedic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Study.,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to disorders affecting orientation, attention, perception, consciousness, and judgment that develop after geriatric orthopedic surgery. Cerebral blood oxygen saturation detection is a way to diagnose cerebral oxygen supply during operation. At present, more and more applications are used for early diagnosis of postoperative cognitive function. Therefore, the present study is to analyze the relationship between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and cerebral blood oxygen saturation in elderly orthopedic patients. This study enrolled 90 elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery in our hospital. According to the postoperative cognitive dysfunction, they were divided into POCD group (<i>N</i> = 45) and no-POCD (<i>N</i> = 45) group. The cognitive and psychological function and cerebral blood oxygen saturation were analyzed before and 3 months after the operation. Finally, the indicators of cognitive psychological function and the indicators of cerebral blood oxygen saturation are correlated and analyzed. Compared with the normal group, patients with cognitive dysfunction at 3 months after surgery time below preoperative rScO2, time below a 10% decrease from preoperative rScO2, CDL preoperative, minimum rScO2 value, and maximum rScO2 value have significant changes. The results of the correlation analysis found that there is also a significant correlation between the postoperative cognitive and psychological function of the patient and the cerebral blood oxygen saturation at 3 weeks after the operation. In elderly orthopedic patients, there is a significant relationship between cerebral blood oxygen saturation detection and cognitive function 3 months after surgery.","Zhu Junqiang, Wang Wei, Shi Huimin",BioMed research international,2021,34712732,PMC8548108,10.1155/2021/5733139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34712732,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8548108,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Call for Diversity: Underrepresented Minorities and Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Fellowship Education.,"This paper is the first of a four-part series that details the current barriers to diversity in the field of adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology and outlines actionable programs that can be implemented to create change.

Making Pain Research More Inclusive: Why and How.,"Current knowledge about mechanisms and interventions for pain has largely been derived from samples that are healthier, wealthier, younger, and more likely to be White than the general population. Failure to conduct inclusive pain research not only restricts generalizability and application of findings, but also hampers the discovery of mechanisms and the development of measures and interventions that are valid across population subgroups. Most of all, inclusive practices are critical to ensure that underrepresented groups derive equitable benefit from pain research. Here, we provide guidance for the pain research community on how to adopt inclusive research practices. We define ""inclusion"" to encompass a range of identities and characteristics, including racialized group/ethnicity, disability status, gender identity, sexual orientation, and age. We first describe principles relevant to promoting inclusion in pain research, including attention to: 1) stakeholder engagement; 2) structural factors underlying inequities; 3) the limitations of ""disparity"" research; 4) intersectionality; and 5) universal design. Next, we provide checklists with practical strategies for making studies more inclusive at each stage of the research process. We conclude by calling for system-level changes to ensure that the future of pain research is socially just, scientifically productive, and responsive to the needs of all people. PERSPECTIVE: This paper offers guidance on promoting inclusion of underrepresented groups in pain research. We describe principles relevant to conducting more inclusive research; eg, attention to stakeholder engagement, structural factors, and universal design. We provide checklists with practical strategies for inclusion at each stage of the research process.","Janevic Mary R, Mathur Vani A, Booker Staja Q, Morais Calia, Meints Samantha M, Yeager Katherine A, Meghani Salimah H",The journal of pain,2022,34678471,PMC9018873,10.1016/j.jpain.2021.10.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34678471,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9018873,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

"Mechanisms of Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Arterial Stiffening in Mice Revealed by a Functional Genetics Assay of Structural, Functional, and Transcriptomic Data.","Hypoxia adversely affects the pulmonary circulation of mammals, including vasoconstriction leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressures. The clinical importance of changes in the structure and function of the large, elastic pulmonary arteries is gaining increased attention, particularly regarding impact in multiple chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. We establish a multi-disciplinary workflow to understand better transcriptional, microstructural, and functional changes of the pulmonary artery in response to sustained hypoxia and how these changes inter-relate. We exposed adult male C57BL/6J mice to normoxic or hypoxic (FiO<sub>2</sub> 10%) conditions. Excised pulmonary arteries were profiled transcriptionally using single cell RNA sequencing, imaged with multiphoton microscopy to determine microstructural features under <i>in vivo</i> relevant multiaxial loading, and phenotyped biomechanically to quantify associated changes in material stiffness and vasoactive capacity. Pulmonary arteries of hypoxic mice exhibited an increased material stiffness that was likely due to collagen remodeling rather than excessive deposition (fibrosis), a change in smooth muscle cell phenotype reflected by decreased contractility and altered orientation aligning these cells in the same direction as the remodeled collagen fibers, endothelial proliferation likely representing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitioning, and a network of cell-type specific transcriptomic changes that drove these changes. These many changes resulted in a system-level increase in pulmonary arterial pulse wave velocity, which may drive a positive feedback loop exacerbating all changes. These findings demonstrate the power of a multi-scale genetic-functional assay. They also highlight the need for systems-level analyses to determine which of the many changes are clinically significant and may be potential therapeutic targets.","Manning Edward P, Ramachandra Abhay B, Schupp Jonas C, Cavinato Cristina, Raredon Micha Sam Brickman, Bärnthaler Thomas, Cosme Carlos, Singh Inderjit, Tellides George, Kaminski Naftali, Humphrey Jay D",Frontiers in physiology,2021,34594238,PMC8478173,10.3389/fphys.2021.726253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594238,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478173,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Mentoring Team Projects for the Doctor of Nursing Practice: Considerations for Nurse Anesthesia Faculty.,"The American Association of Colleges of Nursing and the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs have specified that Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Nursing Anesthesia Practice students complete a doctorate project as part of the education toward becoming Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists. As nurse anesthesia programs (NAPs) transition to DNP entry into practice, management of DNP projects has been identified as a major challenge facing nursing faculty. Also, adequate mentorship has been identified as a crucial part of doctorate education. Despite the absence of literature on team mentorship in nursing, many NAPs are opting for DNP team projects and group mentoring. In team DNP projects, the mentors foster professionalism, establish the ground rules for communication, resolve conflict, and provide expert knowledge. Eﬀective implementation of projects can enhance relational learning and teamwork, which are essential for a successful career in healthcare. Additionally, mentoring teams can simultaneously improve the professional growth of junior faculty, reduce the faculty workload, and improve the quality of DNP projects. This article brings attention to best practices for mentoring DNP team projects and also provides an exemplar of successful implementation of DNP team projects in a NAP.","Aroke Edwin N, Wilbanks Bryan A, Hicks Todd, Thurston Kesha L, McMullan Susan P",AANA journal,2021,34586998,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34586998,,TRUE,Mentoring team projects for Doctor of Nursing Practice students with group mentoring approach,Nurse anesthesia students and faculty in Doctor of Nursing Practice programs,"Enhanced relational learning, teamwork, professional growth of junior faculty, reduced faculty workload, and improved quality of DNP projects",TRUE,"Mentoring DNP team projects, fostering professionalism, establishing communication ground rules, resolving conflict, providing expert knowledge, and improving relational learning and teamwork","Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Nursing Anesthesia Practice students, junior faculty","Enhanced relational learning and teamwork, improved professional growth of junior faculty, reduced faculty workload, improved quality of DNP projects"
Prospective evaluation of remifentanil-propofol mixture for total intravenous anesthesia: A randomized controlled study.,"Application of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) may be considered as unpractical when compared with inhalational anesthesia. Although it is mostly not recommended, mixing intravenous agents is popular in clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of using remifentanil-propofol mixture (MIXTIVA) for TIVA. Adult patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of I-II scheduled for elective thyroidectomy were randomly allocated to 3 groups (n=32 for each) to receive TIVA with remifentanil and propofol infusions separately (control group, Group I) or with MIXTIVA infusion that contained remifentanil/propofol at a proportion of 2/1,000 or 3/1,000 (remifentanil concentration, 20 or 30 µg/ml in 1% propofol in Group II or Group III, respectively). The extubation time (the primary outcome of the study), the orientation time and number of patients in whom intraoperative hypotension, hypertension or bradycardia episodes were encountered during anesthesia were comparable among the groups. The mean remifentanil infusion rate in Group III was significantly higher than that in the other groups. The mean propofol infusion rates and mean bispectral index (BIS) scores during anesthesia were comparable among groups. Hypotension accompanied with a high BIS was encountered in one patient in Group III. In conclusion, compared to the standard TIVA technique using separate drug infusions, MIXTIVA infusion used for thyroidectomies did not result in any statistically significant difference in recovery and clinical outcomes. This technique may be considered as a practical implementation for busy ambulatory centers performing general anesthesia.

Difference between remimazolam toluenesulfonic acid and propofol in waking quality and conscious state after general anesthesia.,"To explore the difference of anesthesia recovery and postoperative conscious state between remimazolam toluenesulfonic acid and propofol after induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. 104 patients undergoing elective tracheal intubation general anesthesia in our hospital were randomly divided into 2 groups: Remimazolam Toluenesulfonic acid group (Group R) and Propofol group (Group P). MOAA/S score, the modified Aldrete score, recovery index, time point, a state of consciousness, interpretative vital signs and adverse events were monitored at different time. Compared with the Group P, the extubation time and orientation recovery time of the Group R were significantly shorter. When the operation time was less than 1 hour, the MOAA/S score of the Group R was shorter than that of Group P at 5 min and 15 min after the operation. To compare with the Group P, the score of MOAA/S in the Group R increased at 5 min, 20 min and 30 min after the operation. When the operation time was less than or equal to 1 h, the modified Aldrete score in the Group R was slightly higher than that in the Group P at 30 min after extubation. There was no injection pain in the the Group R, and the incidence of hypotension was lower than that of propofol.

International consensus on anatomical structures to identify on ultrasound for the performance of basic blocks in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.,"There is no universally agreed set of anatomical structures that must be identified on ultrasound for the performance of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) techniques. This study aimed to produce standardized recommendations for core (minimum) structures to identify during seven basic blocks. An international consensus was sought through a modified Delphi process. A long-list of anatomical structures was refined through serial review by key opinion leaders in UGRA. All rounds were conducted remotely and anonymously to facilitate equal contribution of each participant. Blocks were considered twice in each round: for ""orientation scanning"" (the dynamic process of acquiring the final view) and for the ""block view"" (which visualizes the block site and is maintained for needle insertion/injection). Strong recommendations for inclusion were made if ≥75% of participants rated a structure as ""definitely include"" in any round. Weak recommendations were made if >50% of participants rated a structure as ""definitely include"" or ""probably include"" for all rounds (but the criterion for ""strong recommendation"" was never met). Thirty-six participants (94.7%) completed all rounds. 128 structures were reviewed; a ""strong recommendation"" is made for 35 structures on orientation scanning and 28 for the block view. A ""weak recommendation"" is made for 36 and 20 structures, respectively. This study provides recommendations on the core (minimum) set of anatomical structures to identify during ultrasound scanning for seven basic blocks in UGRA. They are intended to support consistent practice, empower non-experts using basic UGRA techniques, and standardize teaching and research.","Bowness James Simeon, Pawa Amit, Turbitt Lloyd, Bellew Boyne, Bedforth Nigel, Burckett-St Laurent David, Delbos Alain, Elkassabany Nabil, Ferry Jenny, Fox Ben, French James L H, Grant Calum, Gupta Ashwani, Harrop-Griffiths William, Haslam Nat, Higham Helen, Hogg Rosemary, Johnston David F, Kearns Rachel Joyce, Kopp Sandra, Lobo Clara, McKinlay Sonya, Memtsoudis Stavros, Merjavy Peter, Moka Eleni, Narayanan Madan, Narouze Samer, Noble J Alison, Phillips David, Rosenblatt Meg, Sadler Amy, Sebastian Maria Paz, Taylor Alasdair, Thottungal Athmaja, Valdés-Vilches Luis Fernando, Volk Thomas, West Simeon, Wolmarans Morné, Womack Jonathan, Macfarlane Alan James Robert",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,2022,34552005,,10.1136/rapm-2021-103004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552005,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"A multimodal mentorship intervention to improve surgical quality in Tanzania's Lake Zone: a convergent, mixed methods assessment.","Safe, high-quality surgical care in many African countries is a critical need. Challenges include availability of surgical providers, improving quality of care, and building workforce capacity. Despite growing evidence that mentoring is effective in African healthcare settings, less is known about its role in surgery. We examined a multimodal approach to mentorship as part of a safe surgery intervention (Safe Surgery 2020) to improve surgical quality. Our goal was to distill lessons for policy makers, intervention designers, and practitioners on key elements of a successful surgical mentorship program. We used a convergent, mixed-methods design to examine the experiences of mentees, mentors, and facility leaders with mentorship at 10 health facilities in Tanzania's Lake Zone. A multidisciplinary team of mentors worked with surgical providers over 17 months using in-person mentorship, telementoring, and WhatsApp. We conducted surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus groups to capture data in four categories: (1) satisfaction with mentorship; (2) perceived impact; (3) elements of a successful mentoring program; and (4) challenges to implementing mentorship. We analyzed quantitative data using frequency analysis and qualitative data using the constant comparison method. Recurrent and unifying concepts were identified through merging the qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 96% of mentees experienced the intervention as positive, 88% were satisfied, and 100% supported continuing the intervention in the future. Mentees, mentors, and facility leaders perceived improvements in surgical practice, the surgical ecosystem, and in reducing postsurgical infections. Several themes related to the intervention's success emerged: (1) the intervention's design, including its multimodality, side-by-side mentorship, and standardization of practices; (2) the mentee-mentor relationship, including a friendly, safe, non-hierarchical, team relationship, as well as mentors' understanding of the local context; and (3) mentorship characteristics, including non-judgmental feedback, experience, and accessibility. Challenges included resistance to change, shortage of providers, mentorship dose, and logistics. Our study suggests a multimodal mentorship approach is promising in building the capacity of surgical providers. By distilling the experiences of the mentees, mentors, and facility leaders, our lessons provide a foundation for future efforts to establish effective surgical mentorship programs that build provider capacity and ultimately improve surgical quality.","Alidina Shehnaz, Tibyehabwa Leopold, Alreja Sakshie Sanjay, Barash David, Bien-Aime Danta, Cainer Monica, Charles Kevin, Ernest Edwin, Eyembe Joachim, Fitzgerald Laura, Giiti Geofrey C, Hellar Augustino, Hussein Yahaya, Kahindo Furaha, Kenemo Benard, Kihunrwa Albert, Kisakye Steve, Kissima Innocent, Meara John G, Reynolds Cheri, Staffa Steven J, Sydlowski Meaghan, Varallo John, Zanial Noor, Kapologwe Ntuli A, Mayengo Caroline Damian",Human resources for health,2021,34551758,PMC8458007,10.1186/s12960-021-00652-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34551758,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8458007,TRUE,"Multimodal mentorship approach including in-person mentorship, telementoring, and WhatsApp communication",Surgical providers in Tanzania's Lake Zone,"Improved surgical quality, improved surgical practice, enhanced surgical ecosystem, and reduced postsurgical infections",FALSE,,,

"The impact of inhalation anesthetics on early postoperative cognitive function and recovery characteristics in Down syndrome patients: a randomized, double - blind study.","Down syndrome (DS) is associated with intellectual disability. DS patients may be unable to cooperate and often require general anesthesia even for minor surgeries. Rapid recovery significantly contributes to fast-tracking. This prospective randomized, double - blind study investigates the impact of desflurane and sevoflurane on recovery and early postoperative cognitive function of these patients. Forty-four patients undergoing dental surgery, were randomized to receive desflurane (DES-group) or sevoflurane (SEVO-group) for anesthesia maintenance. The primary outcome was postoperative cognitive function (Prudhoe Cognitive Function Test, PCFT) at 90 min and 4 h postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were the time between volatile discontinuation and spontaneous breath, eye opening, extubation, orientation and response to commands, time to achieve an Aldrete score ≥ 9 in the Post-anesthesia Care Unit and time to fulfill discharge criteria (Post Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System, PADSS). At 90 min, PCFT scores significantly decreased from baseline in both groups. Nevertheless, at 4 h, in DES-group there was no significant change from baseline (p = 0.163), while in SEVO-group the decrease remained significant (p < 0.001). Desflurane was also found superior regarding recovery characteristics, such as time to eye opening (p = 0.021), spatial orientation (p = 0.004), response to commands (p = 0.004). Discharge criteria were met earlier in DES-group (p = 0.018 for Aldrete score / p < 0.001 for PADSS). Desflurane was found superior to sevoflurane in terms of faster recovery and better preserved postoperative cognitive function in DS patients undergoing dental surgery. We suggest that desflurane, as part of a multimodal anesthetic approach, could be a useful agent to enhance early discharge from hospital of ambulatory patients with intellectual disability.

"Empowering Women as Leaders in Pediatric Anesthesiology: Methodology, Lessons, and Early Outcomes of a National Initiative.","Research has shown that women have leadership ability equal to or better than that of their male counterparts, yet proportionally fewer women than men achieve leadership positions and promotion in medicine. The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) was founded within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) in 2018 as a multidimensional program to help address the significant career development, leadership, and promotion gender gap between men and women in anesthesiology. Herein, we describe WELI's development and implementation with an early assessment of effectiveness at 2 years. Members received an anonymous, voluntary survey by e-mail to assess whether they believed WELI was beneficial in several broad domains: career development, networking, project implementation and completion, goal setting, mentorship, well-being, and promotion and leadership. The response rate was 60.5% (92 of 152). The majority ranked several aspects of WELI to be very or extremely valuable, including the protégé-advisor dyads, workshops, nomination to join WELI, and virtual facilitated networking. For most members, WELI helped to improve optimism about their professional future. Most also reported that WELI somewhat or absolutely contributed to project improvement or completion, finding new collaborators, and obtaining invitations to be visiting speakers. Among those who applied for promotion or leadership positions, 51% found WELI to be somewhat or absolutely valuable to their application process, and 42% found the same in applying for leadership positions. Qualitative analysis of free-text survey responses identified 5 main themes: (1) feelings of empowerment and confidence, (2) acquisition of new skills in mentoring, coaching, career development, and project implementation, (3) clarification and focus on goal setting, (4) creating meaningful connections through networking, and (5) challenges from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the inability to sustain the advisor-protégé connection. We conclude that after 2 years, the WELI program has successfully supported career development for the majority of protégés and advisors. Continued assessment of whether WELI can meaningfully contribute to attainment of promotion and leadership positions will require study across a longer period. WELI could serve as a programmatic example to support women's career development in other subspecialties.","Schwartz Jamie McElrath, Markowitz Scott D, Yanofsky Samuel D, Tackett Sean, Berenstain Laura K, Schwartz Lawrence I, Flick Randall, Heitmiller Eugenie, Fiadjoe John, Lee Helen H, Honkanen Anita, Malviya Shobha, Cladis Franklyn P, Lee Jennifer K, Deutsch Nina",Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,34517375,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000005740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34517375,,TRUE,"Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) - a multidimensional program including protégé-advisor dyads, workshops, and virtual facilitated networking",Women in pediatric anesthesiology,"Career development, leadership advancement, promotion, project implementation, networking, and addressing the gender gap in anesthesiology",TRUE,"The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) was founded within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) in 2018 as a multidimensional program to help address the significant career development, leadership, and promotion gender gap between men and women in anesthesiology.

Association of Hearing Acuity and Cognitive Function Among a Low-Income Elderly Population in Rural China: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study.,"Hearing loss is a modifiable risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline. However, the association between cognition and hearing acuity at different frequencies is unknown. We aimed to assess the relationships between hearing acuity at different frequencies with global cognitive function and five domains of cognition among a low-income elderly population in northern rural China. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted to collect basic information from elderly residents aged 60 years and older in rural areas of Tianjin, China from April 2012 to November 2013. Pure tone averages (PTAs) at different frequencies in the ear with better hearing and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were measured, and the relationships between these variables were assessed. A total of 737 residents aged 60 years or more were enrolled in this study, and the prevalence of hearing impairment was 60.7%. After adjusting for sex, age, education, income, smoking, drinking, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (LDL-C), MMSE score and immediate recall score were negatively associated with overall PTA (OPTA) at four frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz), PTA at low frequencies (LPTA; 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz), and PTA at high frequencies (HPTA; 3, 4, and 8 kHz) in the ear with better hearing. Moreover, orientation score was negatively associated with OPTA and LPTA, and the attention and calculation scores were negatively associated with OPTA and HPTA. Each 10-dB increase in OPTA was associated with a MMSE score decrease of 0.464. Each 10-dB increase in LPTA or HPTA was associated with a MMSE score decrease of 0.441 (95% CI: -0.795, -0.086) and 0.351 (95% CI: -0.592, -0.110), respectively. The present study demonstrated significant but weak relationships between OPTA, LPTA, and HPTA with global cognitive function, as defined using MMSE scores; these relationships were independent of age, education, lifestyle factors, and laboratory test values. These results indicated that hearing was associated with cognitive decline among older individuals, who should be screened routinely to identify risk for cognitive decline.","Xu Yi, Li Yan, Guo Dandan, Zhang Xin, Guo Huiying, Cao Hui, Li Xin, Zhang Jing, Tu Jun, Wang Jinghua, Ning Xianjia, Yang Dong",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,34483825,PMC8415560,10.3389/fnins.2021.704871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34483825,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415560,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Impact of Mentorship, by Gender, on Career Trajectory in an Academic Anesthesiology Department: A Survey Study.","Mentorship has been identified as a key component of success in business and in academic medicine. After institutional review board approval of the study, an email survey was sent to anesthesiologists in one anesthesiology department to assess mentorship status. A survey link was sent to nonrespondents at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. All participants were deidentified. The identification of a mentor was compared by gender, academic rank, and years of practice. Among 233 anesthesiologists, 103 (44.2%) responded to the survey. More than 90% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that having a mentor is important to career success. Of the 103 respondents, 31 (30%) indicated they had a mentor. Overall, 84% of the identified mentors were men; however, this percentage differed significantly between men and women respondents (95% versus 60%; P = .03). Characteristics associated with having a mentor included younger age (P = .007), fewer years since finishing training (P = .004), and working full time (P = .02). For respondent age and years since finishing training, there was some evidence that the association was dependent on the gender of the respondent (age-by-gender interaction, P = .08; experience-by-gender interaction, P = .08). Anesthesiologists in this department believed that mentorship led to more academic success. Few women mentors were reported, and women were unlikely to identify a mentor once advanced past an assistant professor rank. Most respondents believed that mentorship was important for overall career success, but only approximately one-third identified a mentor at the time of the survey.","Warner Lindsay L, Gali Bhargavi, Oxentenko Amy S, Schroeder Darrell R, Arendt Katherine W, Moeschler Susan M",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,2022,34459437,,10.1097/CEH.0000000000000378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34459437,,TRUE,mentorship,anesthesiologists in an academic anesthesiology department,career success and academic advancement,TRUE,Mentorship,Anesthesiologists in an academic department,More academic success and overall career success
Preventing Delirium and Promoting Long-Term Brain Health: A Clinical Trial Design for the Perioperative Cognitive Enhancement (PROTECT) Trial.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), including postoperative delirium (POD), are common in older adults and, for many, precipitate functional decline and/or dementia. In this protocol, we describe a novel multidisciplinary, multicomponent perioperative intervention that seeks to prevent or reduce POD and associated cognitive decline. We will conduct a prospective, single-blind, pragmatic, randomized-controlled trial to compare our tailored multi-disciplinary perioperative pathway against current standard of care practices. We will recruit a total of 692 elective surgical patients aged 65 years or more and randomize them in a 1:1 design. Our perioperative intervention targets delirium risk reduction strategies by emphasizing the importance of early mobilization, nutrition, hydration, cognitive orientation, sensory aids, and avoiding polypharmacy. To promote healthy behavior change, we will provide a tailored psychoeducation program both pre- and postoperatively, focusing on cardiovascular and psychosocial risks for cognitive and functional decline. Our primary outcome is the incidence of any PND (encapsulating POD and mild or major postoperative neurocognitive disorder) at three months postoperative. Secondary outcomes include any incidence of POD or neurocognitive disorder at 12 months. A specialized delirium screening instrument, the Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM), and a neuropsychological test battery, will inform our primary and secondary outcomes. Delirium is a common and debilitating postoperative complication that contributes to the cognitive and functional decline of older adults. By adopting a multicomponent, multidisciplinary approach to perioperative delirium prevention, we seek to reduce the burden of delirium and subsequent dementia in older adults.","Atkins Kelly J, Scott David A, Silbert Brendan, Pike Kerryn E, Evered Lis",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021,34420958,,10.3233/JAD-210438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34420958,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
To Assess the Technical Feasibility of Ultrasound Lumbar Sympathetic Block with Electrical Stimulation Needle in Out-of-Plane Needle Orientation: A Prospective Interventional Study.,"We describe the technical feasibility of a new technique of ultrasound lumbar sympathectomy validated by fluoroscopy. Prospective interventional study. Pain block area. Thirty patients with peripheral arterial disease with pain at rest (numerical rating score [NRS] ≥3) were recruited. In the lateral position, a curved probe (FUJIFILM SonoSite Edge, Bothell, WA, USA, 2-5 MHz) was placed transversely at the iliac crest. An electrical stimulation needle was inserted out of plane, below the lower pole of the kidneys, directed anterior to the vertebral body below. When the needle tip was not visualized, a current of 2.0 A was applied. Patients' quadriceps contractions, ultrasound psoas contractions, and bone contact guided needle placement, which was confirmed on fluoroscopy. Other parameters noted were the number of needle insertions, vertebral level, pain NRS at baseline and at 4 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks after block, temperature rise, and any other complications. In all patients, the needle tip was correctly placed in one to three attempts. In 73% of patients, the needle tip was at L3. Baseline pain NRS was 8 (interquartile range 7-8), which decreased to 2 (interquartile range 2-3) at 1 week after the procedure, and it was maintained in this range until 2 weeks later. A temperature rise of >2ºC was noted in all patients. Ultrasound lumbar sympathectomy can be performed safely in patients with peripheral arterial disease by an out-of-plane approach in the lateral patient position with an electrical stimulation needle. Before injection of the drug, aspiration of blood should be ruled out in view of the possibility of aortocaval injection.","Marada Snehitha, Punj Jyotsna, Dhar Anita, Bhoi Debesh, Mohan Virender, Trikha Anjan, Pandey Ravindra Kumar, Darlong Vanlal","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2022,34402914,,10.1093/pm/pnab258,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34402914,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among medical students in Southwest China: a cross-sectional study.,"Vaccine hesitancy is an obstacle to COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to inform the vaccine hesitancy and analyze related factors toward COVID-19 vaccination among medical students in China, so as to provide suggestions for increasing vaccines uptake. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among medical students in a medical university and a health school. A total of 2,196 valid questionnaires were received. 41.2% vaccine hesitancy was reported among medical students in total. Female (OR = 1.336) and individuals with higher education (OR = 1.724) reported slightly higher vaccine hesitancy. Being in low-risk areas and no need to get vaccinated (OR = 2.285), fear of serious consequences of vaccination (OR = 1.929), being in good health and no need to be vaccinated (OR = 1.891), being concerned about short-term side effects (OR = 1.793) and being concerned that the vaccine was ineffective (OR = 1.694) had higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Those who were believing the specialty of study or work environment made vaccination necessary (OR = 0.378), believing they were susceptible to COVID-19 (OR = 0.411) and the vaccine was free (OR = 0.519) were more willing to get vaccinated. Confidence in vaccines and perceptions of benefits and risk are associated with vaccine hesitancy. It is important to strengthen vaccine health literacy education for medical students and enhance vaccine confidence. Countries need to supervise the public opinions in social media, television broadcasting and other media, so as to ensure the correct orientation of public opinion. Open and transparent evidence-based information is also needed which can help improve the vaccination coverage rate of the public.","Li Mei, Zheng Yu, Luo Yue, Ren Jianlan, Jiang Linrui, Tang Jian, Yu Xingli, Luo Dongmei, Fan Dinglin, Chen Yanhua",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2021,34357832,PMC8828057,10.1080/21645515.2021.1957648,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34357832,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8828057,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

U.S. medical school admissions and enrollment practices: status of LGBTQ inclusivity.,"The failure to collect information on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) identity in healthcare and medical education is a part of a systemic problem that limits academic medical institutions' ability to address LGBTQ health disparities. To determine whether accurate sexual and gender minority (SGM) demographic data is being consistently collected for all US medical schools during admissions and enrollment, and whether differences exist between collection practices at osteopathic and allopathic schools. Secure, confidential electronic were sent via email in July 2019 to 180 osteopathic (n=42) and allopathic (n=138) medical schools identified through the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Student Guide to Osteopathic Medical Colleges database and the American Association of Medical Colleges Medical School Admissions Requirements database. The nine question survey remained open through October 2019 and queried for; (1) the ability of students to self report SGM status during admissions and enrollment; and (2) availability of SGM specific resources and support services for students. Chi square analysis and the test for equality of proportions were performed. Seventy five of 180 (41.7%) programs responded to the survey; 74 provided at least partial data. Of the 75 respondent schools, 55 (73.3%) allowed applicants to self report a gender identity other than male or female, with 49 (87.5%) of those being allopathic schools compared with 6 (31.6%) osteopathic schools. Similarly, 15 (20.0%) allowed applicants to report sexual orientation, with 14 (25.5%) of those being allopathic schools compared with one (5.3%) osteopathic school. Fifty four of 74 (73.0%) programs allowed matriculants to self report a gender identity other than male or female; 11 of 74 (14.7%) allowed matriculants to report sexual orientation. Demographics collection practices among American medical education programs that responded to our survey indicated that they undervalued sexual orientation and gender identity, with osteopathic programs being less likely than allopathic programs to report inclusive best practices in several areas.

Head-nodding: a driving force for the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid.,"The myodural bridge (MDB) is a dense connective tissue bridge connecting the suboccipital muscles to the spinal dura mater, and it has been proven to be a normal common existing structure in humans and mammals. Some scholars believe that the suboccipital muscles can serve as a dynamic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pump via the MDB, and they found head rotations promote the CSF flow in human body, which provided evidence for this hypothesis. Head movement is a complex motion, but the effects of other forms of head movement on CSF circulation are less known. The present study explored the effects of head-nodding on CSF circulation. The CSF flow of 60 healthy volunteers was analyzed via cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging at the level of the occipitocervical junction before and after one-minute-head-nodding period. Furthermore, the CSF pressures of 100 volunteers were measured via lumbar puncture before and after 5 times head-nodding during their anesthetizing for surgical preparation. As a result, it was found that the maximum and average CSF flow rates at the level of the upper border of atlas during ventricular diastole were significantly decreased from 1.965 ± 0.531 to 1.839 ± 0.460 ml/s and from 0.702 ± 0.253 to 0.606 ± 0.228 ml/s respectively. In the meantime, the changes in the ratio of cranial and caudal orientation of the net flow volume were found differed significantly after the one-minute-head-nodding period (p = 0.017). And on the other hand, the CSF pressures at the L3-L4 level were markedly increased 116.03 ± 26.13 to 124.64 ± 26.18 mmH<sub>2</sub>O. In conclusion, the head-nodding has obvious effects on CSF circulation and head movement is one of the important drivers of cerebrospinal fluid circulation. We propose that the suboccipital muscles, participating in various head movements, might pull the dura sac via the myodural bridge, and thus, head movement provides power for the CSF circulation.","Xu Qiang, Shao Chang-Xi, Zhang Ying, Zhang Yu, Liu Cong, Chen Yu-Xiao, Wang Xue-Mei, Chi Yan-Yan, Yu Sheng-Bo, Sui Hong-Jin",Scientific reports,2021,34244586,PMC8270937,10.1038/s41598-021-93767-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34244586,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270937,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
G-protein activation by a metabotropic glutamate receptor.,"Family C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) operate as obligate dimers with extracellular domains that recognize small ligands, leading to G-protein activation on the transmembrane (TM) domains of these receptors by an unknown mechanism<sup>1</sup>. Here we show structures of homodimers of the family C metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2) in distinct functional states and in complex with heterotrimeric G<sub>i</sub>. Upon activation of the extracellular domain, the two transmembrane domains undergo extensive rearrangement in relative orientation to establish an asymmetric TM6-TM6 interface that promotes conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain of one protomer. Nucleotide-bound G<sub>i</sub> can be observed pre-coupled to inactive mGlu2, but its transition to the nucleotide-free form seems to depend on establishing the active-state TM6-TM6 interface. In contrast to family A and B GPCRs, G-protein coupling does not involve the cytoplasmic opening of TM6 but is facilitated through the coordination of intracellular loops 2 and 3, as well as a critical contribution from the C terminus of the receptor. The findings highlight the synergy of global and local conformational transitions to facilitate a new mode of G-protein activation.","Seven Alpay B, Barros-Álvarez Ximena, de Lapeyrière Marine, Papasergi-Scott Makaía M, Robertson Michael J, Zhang Chensong, Nwokonko Robert M, Gao Yang, Meyerowitz Justin G, Rocher Jean-Philippe, Schelshorn Dominik, Kobilka Brian K, Mathiesen Jesper M, Skiniotis Georgios",Nature,2021,34194039,PMC8822903,10.1038/s41586-021-03680-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34194039,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8822903,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Pulsating fluid flow affects pre-osteoblast behavior and osteogenic differentiation through production of soluble factors.,"Bone mass increases after error-loading, even in the absence of osteocytes. Loaded osteoblasts may produce a combination of growth factors affecting adjacent osteoblast differentiation. We hypothesized that osteoblasts respond to a single load in the short-term (minutes) by changing F-actin stress fiber distribution, in the intermediate-term (hours) by signaling molecule production, and in the long-term (days) by differentiation. Furthermore, growth factors produced during and after mechanical loading by pulsating fluid flow (PFF) will affect osteogenic differentiation.

Computational analysis revealed that PFF immediately changed distribution and magnitude of fluid dynamics over an adherent pre-osteoblast inside a parallel-plate flow chamber (immediate impact). Within 60 min, PFF increased nitric oxide production (5.3-fold), altered actin distribution, but did not affect cell pseudopodia length and cell orientation (initial downstream impact). PFF transiently stimulated Fgf2, Runx2, Ocn, Dmp1, and Col1⍺1 gene expression between 0 and 6 h after PFF cessation. PFF did not affect alkaline phosphatase nor collagen production after 21 days, but altered mineralization after 28 days. In conclusion, a single bout of PFF with indirect associated release of biochemical factors, stimulates osteoblast differentiation in the long-term, which may explain enhanced bone formation resulting from mechanical stimuli.","Jin Jianfeng, Seddiqi Hadi, Bakker Astrid D, Wu Gang, Verstappen Johanna F M, Haroon Mohammad, Korfage Joannes A M, Zandieh-Doulabi Behrouz, Werner Arie, Klein-Nulend Jenneke, Jaspers Richard T",Physiological reports,2021,34174021,PMC8234477,10.14814/phy2.14917,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34174021,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234477,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Vascular access and clinical competency: Which elements matter? The development of three bottom-up and evidence-grounded self-assessment tools.,"Assessing competency in the speciality of vascular access is still limited, and few valid and reliable tools are available. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate three different tools for assessing competency in managing the care of short peripheral cannulas (SPCs), midlines, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs), and arterial catheters (ACs) (tool one), placing SPCs (tool two), placing PICCs and midlines (tool three). A two-phase and multi-method design was adopted. Phase one was implemented to develop the initial pool of items for each tool, starting from a literature overview. Panel discussions were adopted for developing the items. In phase two, the developed items were tested for content and face validity, involving a panel of 10 experts. Once obtained adequate content validity, a cross-sectional data collection was implemented to enroll three samples of healthcare workers who had to assess their competency through the developed tools. Dimensionality was assessed by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) and assessing internal consistency (Cronbach's α). Tool one had 26 items, and the dimensionality was given by placement, risk assessment, procedure conformity and traceability, and patient education to self-care. Tool two had 35 items; its principal components were: risk evaluation, identification, clinical assessment and orientation to self-care, placement, and procedure registration shaped the competency of placing SPCs. Tool three had 31 items; its principal components were: risk assessment, placement, conformity to standards and procedure traceability, education, and orientation to self-care were the essential elements for adequately placing midlines and PICCs. Cronbach's α values ranged between 0.806 and 0.959. The three developed tools reflected the core elements of competency in each application area, representing an initial framework that could be useful in future research and educational projects. Cross-national investigations are required to corroborate the described results.","Rigo Carla, Grazioli Marco, Caravella Giuseppe, Ursino Francesco, Zerla Pietro, Magon Arianna, Dellafiore Federica, Caruso Rosario",The journal of vascular access,2023,34148385,,10.1177/11297298211026447,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34148385,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Experiences with implementation of continuous positive airway pressure for neonates and infants in low-resource settings: A scoping review.,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard of care in providing non-invasive positive pressure support to neonates in respiratory distress in high-resource settings. While safety has been demonstrated in low-resource settings, there is a lack of knowledge on the barriers and facilitators to proper implementation. To identify and describe the barriers, facilitators, and priorities for future implementation of CPAP for neonates and infants in low-resource settings. A systematic search (database inception to March 6, 2020) was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, Global Health, and the WHO Global Index Medicus using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Original research articles pertaining to implementation of CPAP devices in low-resource settings, provider or parent perspectives and experiences with CPAP, cost-benefit analyses, and cost-effectiveness studies were included. Inductive content analysis was conducted. 1385 article were screened and 54 studies across 19 countries met inclusion criteria. Six major themes emerged: device attributes, patient experiences, parent experiences, provider experiences, barriers, and facilitators. Nasal trauma was the most commonly reported complication. Barriers included unreliable electricity and lack of bioengineering support. Facilitators included training, mentorship and empowerment of healthcare providers. Device design, supply chain infrastructure, and training models were imperative to the adoption and sustainability of CPAP. Sustainable implementation of CPAP in low resource settings requires easy-to-use devices, ready access to consumables, and holistic, user-driven training. Further research is necessary on standardizing metrics, interventions that support optimal provider performance, and conditions needed for successful long-term health system integration.","Dada Sara, Ashworth Henry, Sobitschka Alina, Raguveer Vanitha, Sharma Rupam, Hamilton Rebecca L, Burke Thomas",PloS one,2021,34115776,PMC8195417,10.1371/journal.pone.0252718,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34115776,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195417,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Single-center task analysis and user-centered assessment of physical space impacts on emergency Cesarean delivery.,"This study aimed to begin to address this gap using validated techniques in human factors to perform a participatory user-centered analysis of physical space during emergency Cesarean. This study employed a mixed-methods design. Focus group interviews and surveys were administered to a convenience sample (n = 34) of multidisciplinary obstetric teams. Data collected from focus group interviews were used to perform a task and equipment analysis. Survey data were coded and mapped by specialty to identify reported areas of congestion and time spent, and to identify themes related to physical space of the OR and labor and delivery unit. Task analysis revealed complex interdependencies between specialties. Thirty task groupings requiring over 20 pieces of equipment were identified. Perceived areas of congestion and areas of time spent in the OR varied by clinical specialty. The following categories emerged as main challenges encountered during an emergency Cesarean: 1) size of physical space and equipment, 2) layout and orientation, and 3) patient transport. User insights on physical space and workflow processes during emergency Cesarean section at the institution studied revealed challenges related to getting the patients into the OR expediently and having space to perform tasks without crowding or staff injury. By utilizing human factors techniques, other institutions may build upon our findings to improve safety during emergency situations on labor and delivery.","Sotto Kenji T, Hedli Laura C, Sie Lillian, Padua Kimber, Yamada Nicole, Lee Henry, Halamek Louis, Daniels Kay, Nathan-Roberts Dan, Austin Naola S",PloS one,2021,34111177,PMC8191948,10.1371/journal.pone.0252888,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34111177,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191948,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"A pilot, randomized controlled trial of telementorship: A useful tool during social distancing.","During social distancing, resident mentorship may be an unmet need. Telementorship, mentorship through video conferencing software, presents a unique approach to overcome these challenges. This study evaluated whether telementorship through video conference increased access to mentorship encounters and decreased perceived barriers to access, factors that determine likelihood to maintain mentor relationships, and quality of mentorship. A year-long randomized, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2016-2017 with pairs of resident mentors from seven different training programs and medical student mentees, randomized to telementorship or in-person mentorship. The number of quarterly encounters was monitored and demographic predictors of meeting were determined. Likert scale survey responses were analyzed with linear regression. Forty-three of 46 (93.5%) volunteer mentor-mentee pairs participated. Telementorship did not alter likelihood of meeting or attitudes toward mentorship barriers (time and distance). Mentee satisfaction increased from 42.5% to 65.4% (<i>P</i><0.05) throughout the year. Operating room-based practice (<i>P</i><0.05) and higher postgraduate level (<i>P</i>=0.02) decreased the likelihood of meeting. Telementorship provided an equal number of encounters compared to the pairs who were asked to meet in-person. Telementorship may serve as an adjunct modality for flexible communication. Medical mentorship is a key component to medical education. Effective mentorship increases academic research productivity, job satisfaction, and advancement of clinical skills, which translate to improved patient care.","Prionas Nicolas D, Kung Tiffany H, Dohn Ann, Piro Nancy, von Eyben Rie, Katznelson Laurence, Caruso Thomas J",Journal of clinical and translational research,2021,34104809,PMC8177021,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34104809,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177021,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Outcomes of a multicomponent safe surgery intervention in Tanzania's Lake Zone: a prospective, longitudinal study.","Evidence-based strategies for improving surgical quality and patient outcomes in low-resource settings are a priority. To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent safe surgery intervention (Safe Surgery 2020) on (1) adherence to safety practices, teamwork and communication, and documentation in patient files, and (2) incidence of maternal sepsis, postoperative sepsis, and surgical site infection. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study in 10 intervention and 10 control facilities in Tanzania's Lake Zone, across a 3-month pre-intervention period in 2018 and 3-month post-intervention period in 2019. SS2020 is a multicomponent intervention to support four surgical quality areas: (i) leadership and teamwork, (ii) evidence-based surgery, anesthesia and equipment sterilization practices, (iii) data completeness and (iv) infrastructure. Surgical team members received training and mentorship, and each facility received up to a $10 000 infrastructure grant. Inpatients undergoing major surgery and postpartum women were followed during their stay up to 30 days. We assessed adherence to 14 safety and teamwork and communication measures through direct observation in the operating room. We identified maternal sepsis (vaginal or cesarean delivery), postoperative sepsis and SSIs prospectively through daily surveillance and assessed medical record completeness retrospectively through chart review. We compared changes in surgical quality outcomes between intervention and control facilities using difference-in-differences analyses to determine areas of impact. Safety practices improved significantly by an additional 20.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.2-33.7%; P = 0.003) and teamwork and communication conversations by 33.3% (95% CI, 5.7-60.8%; P = 0.02) in intervention facilities compared to control facilities. Maternal sepsis rates reduced significantly by 1% (95% CI, 0.1-1.9%; P = 0.02). Documentation completeness improved by 41.8% (95% CI, 27.4-56.1%; P < 0.001) for sepsis and 22.3% (95% CI, 4.7-39.8%; P = 0.01) for SSIs. Our findings demonstrate the benefit of the SS2020 approach. Improvement was observed in adherence to safety practices, teamwork and communication, and data quality, and there was a reduction in maternal sepsis rates. Our results support the emerging evidence that improving surgical quality in a low-resource setting requires a focus on the surgical system and culture. Investigation in diverse contexts is necessary to confirm and generalize our results and to understand how to adapt the intervention for different settings. Further work is also necessary to assess the long-term effect and sustainability of such interventions.","Alidina Shehnaz, Menon Gopal, Staffa Steven J, Alreja Sakshie, Barash David, Barringer Erin, Cainer Monica, Citron Isabelle, DiMeo Amanda, Ernest Edwin, Fitzgerald Laura, Ghandour Hiba, Gruendl Magdalena, Hellar Audustino, Jumbam Desmond T, Katoto Adam, Kelly Lauren, Kisakye Steve, Kuchukhidze Salome, Lama Tenzing, Lodge Ii William, Maina Erastus, Massaga Fabian, Mazhiqi Adelina, Meara John G, Mshana Stella, Nason Ian, Reynolds Chase, Reynolds Cheri, Segirinya Hannington, Simba Dorcas, Smith Victoria, Strader Christopher, Sydlowski Meaghan, Tibyehabwa Leopold, Tinuga Florian, Troxel Alena, Ulisubisya Mpoki, Varallo John, Wurdeman Taylor, Zanial Noor, Zurakowski David, Kapologwe Ntuli, Maongezi Sarah",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,2021,34057187,PMC8240014,10.1093/intqhc/mzab087,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34057187,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240014,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Multicomponent safe surgery intervention (Safe Surgery 2020) which includes leadership and teamwork, evidence-based surgery, anesthesia and equipment sterilization practices, data completeness and infrastructure.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 pediatric anesthesiology fellowship application cycle: A survey of applicants.,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a situation with an urgent need to produce a virtual system for the 2019-2020 pediatric anesthesiology fellowship cycle. With fellowship interviews beginning in April 2020, there was minimal time to adapt. Each program rapidly developed its own platform, expectations, materials, and process for interviews, and applicants were exposed to a wide array of variability in the process-all while under the stress of interviewing for fellowship positions. The aim of this survey-based study was to obtain input from applicants to help guide program decisions about ""best practice"" for the future for both pediatric anesthesiology and other graduate medical education matches. A 28-question survey was developed utilizing Qualtrics. An anonymous link was sent to all pediatric anesthesiology program directors for distribution of the survey link to all recently matched applicants. Incoming fellows who were accepted outside of the match process were also invited to respond. Fifty respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 30% based on the 167 matched fellowship positions nationwide (50/167). A majority of the respondents reported they felt virtual interviews allowed them to learn the following things equally as well compared with a traditional interview about fellowship programs: salary and benefits, available academic opportunities, available clinical opportunities, clinical schedule of the fellowship, mentorship opportunities, clinical experience and training of the fellowship, and expected work-life balance during fellowship. Respondents report that the most important factors in making their rank list were perceived goodness of fit, desired geographic location, and perception of program leadership. Additionally, respondents ranked the types of information and interactions that they found most helpful to make decisions. All respondents reported the benefit of cost savings compared to a traditional application cycle, with the most commonly reported estimated savings being $3,000-$5,000 per respondent. These results allow recommendations for ""best practices"" for virtual interviews to include programs providing an electronic packet of information prior to the interview day, providing dedicated time for applicants to interact with current fellows, providing applicants an understanding of the city/region of the location of the program, and offering a completely optional postinterview visit, when possible. Based on the results of this survey, we recommend that programs continue to offer virtual interviews as a penalty-free option for applicants, even when in-person interviews may be feasible.","DiGiusto Matthew, Lupa Maria Concetta, Corridore Marco, Sivak Erica L, Lockman Justin L",Paediatric anaesthesia,2021,34053178,,10.1111/pan.14226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34053178,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Intrasubunit and Intersubunit Steroid Binding Sites Independently and Additively Mediate <i>α</i>1<i>β</i>2<i>γ</i>2L GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptor Potentiation by the Endogenous Neurosteroid Allopregnanolone.,"Prior work employing functional analysis, photolabeling, and X-ray crystallography have identified three distinct binding sites for potentiating steroids in the heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. The sites are located in the membrane-spanning domains of the receptor at the <i>β</i>-<i>α</i> subunit interface (site I) and within the <i>α</i> (site II) and <i>β</i> subunits (site III). Here, we have investigated the effects of mutations to these sites on potentiation of the rat <i>α</i>1<i>β</i>2<i>γ</i>2L GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by the endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone (3<i>α</i>5<i>α</i>P). The mutations were introduced alone or in combination to probe the additivity of effects. We show that the effects of amino acid substitutions in sites I and II are energetically additive, indicating independence of the actions of the two steroid binding sites. In site III, none of the mutations tested reduced potentiation by 3<i>α</i>5<i>α</i>P, nor did a mutation in site III modify the effects of mutations in sites I or II. We infer that the binding sites for 3<i>α</i>5<i>α</i>P act independently. The independence of steroid action at each site is supported by photolabeling data showing that mutations in either site I or site II selectively change steroid orientation in the mutated site without affecting labeling at the unmutated site. The findings are discussed in the context of linking energetic additivity to empirical changes in receptor function and ligand binding. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Prior work has identified three distinct binding sites for potentiating steroids in the heteromeric <i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid type A receptor. This study shows that the sites act independently and additively in the presence of the steroid allopregnanolone and provide estimates of energetic contributions made by steroid binding to each site.","Germann Allison L, Pierce Spencer R, Tateiwa Hiroki, Sugasawa Yusuke, Reichert David E, Evers Alex S, Steinbach Joe Henry, Akk Gustav",Molecular pharmacology,2021,33958479,PMC8256884,10.1124/molpharm.121.000268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33958479,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256884,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Higher Dispositional Optimism Predicts Better Health-Related Quality of Life After Esophageal Cancer Surgery: A Nationwide Population-Based Longitudinal Study.,"To assess whether higher dispositional optimism could predict better health-related quality of life (HRQL) after esophageal cancer surgery. This Swedish nationwide longitudinal study included 192 patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer. The exposure was dispositional optimism measured by the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) at 1 year post-surgery. Patients were categorized into four subgroups (very low, moderately low, moderately high, and very high dispositional optimism) based on the quartile of the LOT-R sum score. The outcome was HRQL assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Esophago-Gastric module 25 (QLQ-OG25) at 1, 1.5, and 2 years post-surgery. Linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to examine the mean score difference (MSD) with 95% confidence interval of HRQL among the four patient subgroups. Patients with very high dispositional optimism reported clinically relevantly better global quality of life, emotional function, and social function (MSD range 10-16) and less severe symptoms in pain, dyspnea, diarrhea, eating difficulty, anxiety, dry mouth, trouble with taste, worry about weight loss, and self-doubt about body image (MSD range - 9 to - 22) than patients with lower dispositional optimism. Patients with moderately high dispositional optimism reported clinically and statistically significantly better global quality of life (MSD 10) and less severe diarrhea (MSD - 9) than patients with lower dispositional optimism. Adjusted MSDs were constant over the three time points in all aspects except for eating difficulty. Measuring dispositional optimism could help identify patients at higher risk of poor HRQL recovery after esophageal cancer surgery.","Liu Yangjun, Pettersson Erik, Schandl Anna, Markar Sheraz, Johar Asif, Lagergren Pernilla",Annals of surgical oncology,2021,33876352,PMC8521517,10.1245/s10434-021-10026-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33876352,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8521517,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
3D-printed cell-free PCL-MECM scaffold with biomimetic micro-structure and micro-environment to enhance in situ meniscus regeneration.,"Despite intensive effort was made to regenerate injured meniscus by cell-free strategies through recruiting endogenous stem/progenitor cells, meniscus regeneration remains a great challenge in clinic. In this study, we found decellularized meniscal extracellular matrix (MECM) preserved native meniscal collagen and glycosaminoglycans which could be a good endogenous regeneration guider for stem cells. Moreover, MECM significantly promoted meniscal fibrochondrocytes viability and proliferation, increased the expression of type II collagen and proteoglycans in vitro. Meanwhile, we designed 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds which mimic the circumferential and radial collagen orientation in native meniscus. Taken these two advantages together, a micro-structure and micro-environment dually biomimetic cell-free scaffold was manipulated. This cell-free PCL-MECM scaffold displayed superior biocompatibility and yielded favorable biomechanical capacities closely to native meniscus. Strikingly, neo-menisci were regenerated within PCL-MECM scaffolds which were transplanted into knee joints underwent medial meniscectomy in rabbits and sheep models. Histological staining confirmed neo-menisci showed meniscus-like heterogeneous staining. Mankin scores showed PCL-MECM scaffold could protect articular cartilage well, and knee X-ray examination revealed same results. Knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning also showed some neo-menisci in PCL-MECM scaffold group. In conclusion, PCL-MECM scaffold appears to optimize meniscus regeneration. This could represent a promising approach worthy of further investigation in preclinical applications.","Guo Weimin, Chen Mingxue, Wang Zhenyong, Tian Yue, Zheng Jinxuan, Gao Shuang, Li Yangyang, Zheng Yufeng, Li Xu, Huang Jingxiang, Niu Wei, Jiang Shuangpeng, Hao Chunxiang, Yuan Zhiguo, Zhang Yu, Wang Mingjie, Wang Zehao, Peng Jiang, Wang Aiyuan, Wang Yu, Sui Xiang, Xu Wenjing, Hao Libo, Zheng Xifu, Liu Shuyun, Guo Quanyi",Bioactive materials,2021,33869902,PMC8039774,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.02.019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33869902,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039774,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Elevated sTREM2 and NFL levels in patients with sepsis associated encephalopathy.,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common manifestation of sepsis that may lead to cognitive decline. Our aim was to investigate whether the neurofilament light chain (NFL) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) could be utilized as prognostic biomarkers in SAE. In this prospective observational study, baseline serum levels of sTREM2 and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM2 and NFL were measured by ELISA in 11 SAE patients and controls. Patients underwent daily neurological examination. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standard electroencephalography (EEG) were performed. Cognitive dysfunction was longitudinally assessed after discharge in 4 SAE patients using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) tests. SAE patients showed higher CSF sTREM2 and NFL levels than controls. sTREM2 and NFL levels were not correlated with the severity measures of sepsis. Three months after discharge, 2 SAE patients displayed ACE-R scores congruent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), persisting in one patient 12 months after discharge. SAE patients with MCI showed higher CSF NFL levels, bacteremia, and abnormal brain MRI. Patients with increased serum/CSF sTREM2 levels showed trends towards displaying poorer attention/orientation and visuo-spatial skills. sTREM2 and NFL levels may serve as a prognostic biomarker for cognitive decline in SAE. These results lend further support for the involvement of glial activation and neuroaxonal degeneration in the physiopathology of SAE.","Orhun Günseli, Esen Figen, Yilmaz Vuslat, Ulusoy Canan, Şanlı Elif, Yıldırım Elif, Gürvit Hakan, Ergin Özcan Perihan, Sencer Serra, Bebek Nerses, Tüzün Erdem",The International journal of neuroscience,2023,33851572,,10.1080/00207454.2021.1916489,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33851572,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Sevoflurane <i>versus</i> halothane for induction of anesthesia in pediatric and adult patients.,"Induction of anesthesia using an inhalation agent remains a fundamental technique due to its rapid induction and emergence. Sevoflurane is preferred over halothane for its faster induction of anesthesia and lesser complications. Studies on sevoflurane in pediatrics have established it as safe and effective. However, its effectiveness in adults is very limited. Hence, this study was conducted to compare the induction and intubating conditions, hemodynamic profiles, and emergence from anesthesia with sevoflurane and halothane in adults and pediatric patients. This randomized clinical study was carried out for a period of 2 years (November 2006-September 2008) in the Anesthesiology Department of a Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (Deemed to be) University. Eighty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I and II were randomly assigned to halothane group and sevoflurane group with 40 patients in each group. Patients were induced and intubated with increasing concentrations of halothane from 0.5% to 5% and sevoflurane 1% to 7% in 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen mixture. Recordings of vitals including induction and intubation time, recovery characteristics, and recovery and discharge time was also recorded. There was a statistically significant difference between sevoflurane and halothane in the induction and intubation time indicating that sevoflurane had faster induction and shorter intubation time compared to that of halothane. Patients in halothane group had more incidence of coughing, intolerance, salivation, breathe holding, rigidity, and movement as compared to sevoflurane group. The mean time to consciousness, response to verbal commands, orientation, and recovery room discharge time was significantly shorter in sevoflurane group as compared to halothane group. Sevoflurane can be a suitable alternative to halothane for induction of anesthesia in patients with a shorter induction and intubation time with better hemodynamic stability.

Anesthesia screen use may impact operating room communication practices in otolaryngology.,"Failures in communication are a leading contributor to medical error. There is increasing attention on cultivating robust communication practices in the Operating Room (OR) to mitigate against patient injury and optimize efficient patient care. Few studies have evaluated how surgical equipment may introduce barriers to team dynamics. We conducted a pilot observational study to examine the relationship between anesthesia screen drapes (which are used inconsistently) and the frequency of verbal exchanges between surgical and anesthesia members. 25 procedures spanning various procedures in Otolaryngology were covertly observed, 12 of which employed a screen. Verbal exchanges were recorded across three stages of the surgery: pre-procedure (before the draping), procedure (drapes placed throughout) and post-procedure (after the removal of the draping). Speaker and content of the exchange was noted as well as various features about the procedure. Decreases in rates of exchanges were most pronounced during the procedure stage, although they did not reach significance on T-testing (p = 0.0719). After controlling for attending, table orientation and number of professionals, regression analysis did reveal a statistically significant decrease in rates of verbal exchanges during the procedure in the presence of the anesthesia screen (7.17 (± 6.33) versus 2.23 (± 1.00), p = 0.0318). Differences were also significant among surgeon-initiated and patient-care-related exchanges (p = 0.0168 and p = 0.0432, respectively). Decreases in anesthesiologist-initiated and non-clinical exchanges did not reach significance (p = 0.1530 and p = 0.5120, respectively). This pilot study suggests that anesthesia screens may negatively impact communication practices in the OR.","Bourdillon Alexandra T, Mehra Saral, Rahmati Rahmatullah, Judson Benjamin, Edwards Heather A",American journal of otolaryngology,2021,33812208,,10.1016/j.amjoto.2021.103000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33812208,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Closing the Mentorship Gap: Implementation of Speed Mentoring Events for Women Faculty and Trainees in Anesthesiology.,"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Mentorship is a key component to success in academic medicine. Women are under-represented in leadership positions within medicine. Women are less likely to identify mentors than men. Speed mentoring is an innovative strategy to facilitate mentorship in academic medicine. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> A speed mentoring event for women faculty members in an academic anesthesiology department was held, followed by a second event for trainees. Attendees completed surveys about mentorship experiences at baseline and in follow-up. Questions were rated on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree with values reported as median (1st, 3rd quartile). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Baseline surveys indicated poor satisfaction with mentoring in the prior 6 months as 4.5 (3, 5.25). Twelve months later, mentees reported increased satisfaction with mentoring 6 (6, 6). Mentors and mentees felt their time was well spent during both events. There was an increase in the number of mentors identified after the events by both groups. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our results suggest speed mentoring is well received and impactful with minimal time and monetary investment. The attendees of the events identified an increased number of mentors after speed mentoring events, and this effect was maintained at 6-12 months. Speed mentoring may be one path to providing support for women to advance their careers in academic medicine. More research is warranted to better evaluate effectiveness of formats such as speed mentoring to facilitate improved mentorship for women in academic anesthesiology.","Pollard E Morgan, Sharpe Emily E, Gali Bhargavi, Moeschler Susan M","Women's health reports (New Rochelle, N.Y.)",2021,33786528,PMC7935037,10.1089/whr.2020.0095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33786528,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935037,TRUE,Speed mentoring events,Women faculty and trainees in anesthesiology,"Increased mentorship opportunities, improved satisfaction with mentoring, and career advancement for women in academic anesthesiology",TRUE,Speed mentoring,Women faculty members and trainees in an academic anesthesiology department,"Increased satisfaction with mentoring, identification of more mentors, support for women to advance their careers in academic medicine"
Training the Trainer: Preparing Anesthesiology Residents to be Trainers in the Operating Room.,"The transition into clinical anesthesiology is a challenging period that requires swift acquisition of clinical knowledge and procedural skills. Senior residents are in a prime position to help their junior colleagues into the operating room environment due to their ability to relate from personal experience. We created a workshop for enhancing peer apprenticeship during this transition. The workshop consisted of PowerPoint didactics interspersed with small-group practice sessions. Surveys were administered pre-, post-, 1-week post-, and 1-month postworkshop. The primary outcome was pre-post improvement in the proportion of residents prepared to be a trainer. Secondary outcomes included pre- to 1-week postworkshop improvement, pre-postworkshop change in knowledge of learning theory concepts, and pre-postworkshop change in first-year clinical anesthesiology perceptions of trainers. Of residents, 12 of 43 (28%) eligible to be resident trainers attended the workshop. The proportion of residents who felt prepared increased from 75% preworkshop to 100% postworkshop and remained at 93% at 1 week. Knowledge of cognitive load and microskills improved from 0% preworkshop to 83% postworkshop but dropped to 0% at 1 month. Comfort using microskills improved from 0% preworkshop to 83% postworkshop. Early anesthesiology training demands rapid acquisition of novel cognitive and procedural skills. Senior anesthesiology residents are in a prime position to train junior residents, yet many are uncomfortable with this role. We developed a workshop to transition residents into a peer trainer role and significantly increased their confidence to be a trainer. Other programs may benefit from implementing similar training.","Huang Jeffrey, Licatino Lauren, Sims Charles R",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2021,33768148,PMC7970634,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768148,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970634,TRUE,"Workshop for senior residents to enhance peer apprenticeship, consisting of PowerPoint didactics and small-group practice sessions focused on learning theory concepts and microskills",Senior anesthesiology residents who serve as trainers for junior residents transitioning into clinical anesthesiology,"Increased preparedness and confidence of senior residents to serve as trainers, improved knowledge of learning theory concepts, and enhanced training experience for junior residents entering the operating room environment",TRUE,A workshop consisting of PowerPoint didactics interspersed with small-group practice sessions,Senior anesthesiology residents,"Increased confidence and preparedness in senior residents to train junior residents, improved knowledge of cognitive load and microskills"
Survey of the triple-mentoring program for students at a religious medical school.,"Tzu Chi University in Taiwan offers a unique mentoring program. This program differs from others as it comprises triple mentorship, namely, faculty mentors, Tzu Cheng/Yi De (TC/YD; senior volunteers), and school counselors. This study aimed to survey the role functions of the mentors from the perspective of medical students. The Role Functions of the Mentoring Program Scale (RFMPS) was developed on the basis of literature reviews and focus groups and it underwent exploratory factor analysis for internal consistency and reliability. RFMPS comprises four role functions, namely, mental, educational, career, and humanistic/moral guidance counseling. The survey was distributed to 171 medical students via an online network with two-month intervals and was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. The overall response rate was 64% (116/171). The mean scores of the four role functions in descending order belonged to faculty mentors, TC/YD, and school counselors. For humanistic/moral guidance, students had an equal preference for the faculty mentors and TC/YD over school counselors. As for educational, career, and mental guidance counseling, students preferred faculty mentors over TC/YD and school counselors. Faculty mentors provided students with the required guidance counseling for all the four role functions, especially educational guidance; TC/YD in particular offered prominent humanistic/moral guidance and career counseling; school counselors were less preferred but guided students in need. Medical students value different role functions provided by faculty mentors, TC/YD, and school counselors. A diversified focus could be provided by the faculty mentors, particularly in educational, career, mental, and humanistic/moral counseling; TC/YD specialized in humanistic/moral guidance; and the school counselors carried out their role function only when needed. Humanistic/moral guidance is equally preferred to other types of guidance, which can be equally valuable in future mentoring programs.","Tseng Ting-Chun, Chen Tsung-Ying, Chu Shao-Yin, Wang Hung-Che, Chang Ching-Yuan",BMC medical education,2021,33726739,PMC7970779,10.1186/s12909-021-02593-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33726739,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970779,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Current status and solutions for gender equity in anaesthesia research.,"Despite increasing numbers of women entering anaesthesia, they remain persistently under-represented within academic anaesthesia and research. Gender discordance is seen across multiple aspects of research, including authorship, editorship, peer review, grant receipt, speaking and leading. Women are also under-represented at higher faculty ranks and in department chair positions. These inequities are further magnified for women with intersectional identities, such as those who identify as Black, indigenous and women of colour. Several barriers to participation in research have been identified to date, including a disproportionate amount of family responsibilities, a disproportionate burden of clinical service, gender bias, sexual harassment and the gender pay gap. Several strategies to improve gender equity have been proposed. Increasing access to formal mentorship of women in academic medicine is frequently cited and has been used by healthcare institutions and medical societies. Senior faculty and leaders must also be conscious of including women in sponsorship and networking opportunities. Institutions should provide support for parents of all genders, including supportive parental leave policies and flexible work models. Women should also be materially supported to attend formal educational conferences targeted for women, aimed at improving networking, peer support and professional development. Finally, leaders must display a clear intolerance for sexual harassment and discrimination to drive culture change. Peers and leaders alike, of all genders, can act as upstanders and speak up on behalf of targets of discrimination, both in the moment or after the fact. Gender inequities have persisted for far too long and can no longer be ignored. Diversifying the anaesthesia research community is essential to the future of the field.","Flexman A M, Shillcutt S K, Davies S, Lorello G R",Anaesthesia,2021,33682100,,10.1111/anae.15361,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33682100,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Increasing access to formal mentorship of women in academic medicine, including women in sponsorship and networking opportunities.

Spatially mapped single-cell chromatin accessibility.,"High-throughput single-cell epigenomic assays can resolve cell type heterogeneity in complex tissues, however, spatial orientation is lost. Here, we present single-cell combinatorial indexing on Microbiopsies Assigned to Positions for the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin, or sciMAP-ATAC, as a method for highly scalable, spatially resolved, single-cell profiling of chromatin states. sciMAP-ATAC produces data of equivalent quality to non-spatial sci-ATAC and retains the positional information of each cell within a 214 micron cubic region, with up to hundreds of tracked positions in a single experiment. We apply sciMAP-ATAC to assess cortical lamination in the adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex and in the human primary visual cortex, where we produce spatial trajectories and integrate our data with non-spatial single-nucleus RNA and other chromatin accessibility single-cell datasets. Finally, we characterize the spatially progressive nature of cerebral ischemic infarction in the mouse brain using a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.","Thornton Casey A, Mulqueen Ryan M, Torkenczy Kristof A, Nishida Andrew, Lowenstein Eve G, Fields Andrew J, Steemers Frank J, Zhang Wenri, McConnell Heather L, Woltjer Randy L, Mishra Anusha, Wright Kevin M, Adey Andrew C",Nature communications,2021,33627658,PMC7904839,10.1038/s41467-021-21515-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33627658,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7904839,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Gender pay disparity in anesthesiology.,"The purpose of this review is to look at the historical and current gender pay gap in healthcare, specifically in the field of anesthesiology, as well as discuss some of the reasons for the difference in compensation and its consequences. Future aims and directions to bridge the gap will also be explored. Even though women have achieved equality in terms of admission to medical school and residency programs, disparities still exist in terms of compensation for equal or comparable work. However, institutional initiatives to close the pay gap have achieved success. In order to improve the gender pay inequality, there needs to be continuous efforts on the institutional level for recognition of the disparity, initiation of programs for mentorship and sponsorship for female faculties, and continuous monitoring of the effect of the programs.","Hu Yaqi, Couser Deanna",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2021,33606397,,10.1097/ACO.0000000000000972,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33606397,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,Initiation of programs for mentorship and sponsorship for female faculties,Female faculties in the field of anesthesiology,Improvement of the gender pay inequality
Effect of the orientation of microskin on the survival rate of transplantation and improving the method.,"The direction of microskin transplantation is difficult to control, and the survival rate is critically affected. In this study, we show for the first time that survival rate of transplantation was improved by changing the direction of microskin. A human split-thickness skin graft was prepared as microskin (size of 1 mm × 1 mm), and was transplanted onto a wound in nude mice. The effect of the orientation of microskin on the survival rate of transplants was observed. The collagen membrane was first attached to the epidermal surface of pig skin, which was then cut into microskin and then they were floated on physiological saline. The effect of the collagen membrane on the orientation of microskin was observed. Then the microskin of pig with an epidermal surface attached to the collagen membrane was transplanted to the wound of the pig, and the survival rate of transplants was observed. In the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> week after transplantation of nude mice, the wound healing rate in group A (all of the microskin's epidermal surface was upward) was significantly higher than in other groups (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The floating rate and the forward floating rate in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Four weeks after microskin transplantation of pigs, the wound contraction rate in group A, compared with group B, was significantly lower, and the wound healing rate was significantly higher (<i>P</i> < 0.01). In microskin grafting, the direction of microskin significantly affects the survival rate of transplantation. The method of adhering the collagen membrane to the epidermal surface of microskin may ensure complete floating of microskin on the physiological saline with the epidermal surface facing up. This is a new method to improve the survival rate of microskin grafting.","Zheng Xiaopeng, Li Xuan, Chen Tiansheng, Chang Fei, Ji Shizhao, Hu Xiaoyan, Xiao Shichu",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,2021,33564351,PMC7868789,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33564351,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868789,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

In this review, we focus on the challenges and opportunities of clinical epigenomics in cardiovascular disease. As an integrator of genetic and environmental inputs, and because of advances in measurement techniques that are highly reproducible and provide sequence information, the epigenome is a rich source of potential biosignatures of cardiovascular health and disease. Most of the studies to date have focused on the latter, and herein we discuss observations on epigenomic changes in human cardiovascular disease, examining the role of protein modifiers of chromatin, noncoding RNAs and DNA modification. We provide an overview of cardiovascular epigenomics, discussing the challenges of data sovereignty, data analysis, doctor-patient ethics and innovations necessary to implement precision health.","Fischer Matthew A, Vondriska Thomas M",Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2021,33561434,PMC8330446,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.01.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561434,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330446,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Longitudinal Narrative Analysis of Parent Experiences During Graded Exposure Treatment for Children With Chronic Pain.,"Parents have a vital influence over their child's chronic pain treatment and management. Graded exposure in vivo treatment (GET) is emerging as a promising intervention for youth with chronic pain. Yet, little is known about how parents perceive GET and its impact on their child's pain condition. This study aimed to characterize caregivers' experiences over the course of their child's GET using longitudinal coding and thematic analysis of parent narratives. Parent narratives of 15 youth who participated in GET for pediatric chronic pain (GET Living) were elicited from an unstructured dialogue at the start of each treatment session held between the parent(s) and pain psychologist. Narratives were coded for affect and content, and trends were examined in these codes across sessions. Common themes in parent narratives were developed through inductive thematic analysis. Parents showed an increase in positive affect, treatment confidence, and optimism over the course of treatment. Narratives also expressed more benefit-finding/growth and less anxiety and protectiveness across GET sessions, with more parents having a resolved orientation towards their child's pain by the final session. Five common themes were generated: Self-Awareness, Understanding of Their Child's Perspective, Perceived Treatment Benefit, Internalization of Treatment Principles, and Hopeful Concern for the Future. Analysis of parent narratives provides a rich and unique method for understanding a parent's journey during their child's chronic pain treatment. Clinical application of our findings can be used to guide future developments of targeted topics and interventions in the context of parenting a child with chronic pain.","Corey Jenelle R, Heathcote Lauren C, Mahmud Farah, Kronman Corey, Mukerji Cora, McGinnis Ellen, Noel Melanie, Sieberg Christine, Simons Laura E",The Clinical journal of pain,2021,33555695,PMC7953686,10.1097/AJP.0000000000000921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33555695,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953686,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Improving surgical quality in low-income and middle-income countries: why do some health facilities perform better than others?,"Evidence on heterogeneity in outcomes of surgical quality interventions in low-income and middle-income countries is limited. We explored factors driving performance in the Safe Surgery 2020 intervention in Tanzania's Lake Zone to distil implementation lessons for low-resource settings. We identified higher (n=3) and lower (n=3) performers from quantitative data on improvement from 14 safety and teamwork and communication indicators at 0 and 12 months from 10 intervention facilities, using a positive deviance framework. From 72 key informant interviews with surgical providers across facilities at 1, 6 and 12 months, we used a grounded theory approach to identify practices of higher and lower performers. Performance experiences of higher and lower performers differed on the following themes: (1) preintervention context, (2) engagement with Safe Surgery 2020 interventions, (3) teamwork and communication orientation, (4) collective learning orientation, (5) role of leadership, and (6) perceived impact of Safe Surgery 2020 and beyond. Higher performers had a culture of teamwork which helped them capitalise on Safe Surgery 2020 to improve surgical ecosystems holistically on safety practices, teamwork and communication. Lower performers prioritised overhauling safety practices and began considering organisational cultural changes much later. Thus, while also improving, lower performers prioritised different goals and trailed higher performers on the change continuum. Future interventions should be tailored to facility context and invest in strengthening teamwork, communication and collective learning and facilitate leadership engagement to build a receptive climate for successful implementation of safe surgery interventions.","Alidina Shehnaz, Chatterjee Pritha, Zanial Noor, Alreja Sakshie Sanjay, Balira Rebecca, Barash David, Ernest Edwin, Giiti Geofrey Charles, Maina Erastus, Mazhiqi Adelina, Mushi Rahma, Reynolds Cheri, Sydlowski Meaghan, Tinuga Florian, Maongezi Sarah, Meara John G, Kapologwe Ntuli A, Barringer Erin, Cainer Monica, Citron Isabelle, DiMeo Amanda, Fitzgerald Laura, Ghandour Hiba, Gruendl Magdalena, Hellar Augustino, Jumbam Desmond T, Katoto Adam, Kelly Lauren, Kisakye Steve, Kuchukhidze Salome, Lama Tenzing N, Menon Gopal, Mshana Stella, Reynolds Chase, Segirinya Hannington, Simba Dorcas, Smith Victoria, Staffa Steven J, Strader Christopher, Tibyehabwa Leopold, Troxel Alena, Varallo John, Wurdeman Taylor, Zurakowski David",BMJ quality & safety,2021,33547219,PMC8606467,10.1136/bmjqs-2020-011795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33547219,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606467,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Nonadministration of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is less common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,"The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is higher than most other hospitalized patients. Nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is common and is associated with VTE events. Our objective was to determine whether nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is more common in patients with COVID-19 versus other hospitalized patients. In this retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients discharged from the Johns hopkins hospital between Mar 1 and May 12, 2020, we compared demographic, clinical characteristics, VTE outcomes, prescription and administration of VTE prophylaxis between COVID-19 positive, negative, and not tested groups. Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were significantly older, and more likely to be Hispanic, have a higher median body mass index, have longer hospital length of stay, require mechanical ventilation, develop pulmonary embolism and die (all p < 0.001). COVID-19 patients were more likely to be prescribed (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.38-1.66) and receive all doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.62). The number of patients who missed at least one dose of VTE prophylaxis and developed VTE was similar between the three groups (p = 0.31). It is unlikely that high rates of VTE in COVID-19 are due to nonadministration of doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Hence, we should prioritize research into alternative approaches to optimizing VTE prevention in patients with COVID-19.","Varasteh Kia Mujan, Lau Brandyn D, Owodunni Oluwafemi P, Kraus Peggy S, Holzmueller Christine G, Hobson Deborah B, Shaffer Dauryne L, Streiff Michael B, Haut Elliott R",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2021,33507453,PMC7840619,10.1007/s11239-021-02384-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33507453,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7840619,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Interdisciplinary Online Hackathons as an Approach to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the lives of millions of people by causing a dramatic impact on many health care systems and the global economy. This devastating pandemic has brought together communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented manner. This case study describes the steps and methods employed in the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear implementation road map for other organizations to follow. This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six COVID-19-related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event, participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5 optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey. A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75 mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants who provided feedback, 60% (n=18) would not have started their project without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by their mentors, and creating a functional prototype. This study provides insights into how online hackathons can contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity, increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation, organization, and evaluation of this online hackathon are useful for other institutions and initiatives that are willing to introduce similar event formats in the fight against COVID-19.","Braune Katarina, Rojas Pablo-David, Hofferbert Joscha, Valera Sosa Alvaro, Lebedev Anastasiya, Balzer Felix, Thun Sylvia, Lieber Sascha, Kirchberger Valerie, Poncette Akira-Sebastian",Journal of medical Internet research,2021,33497350,PMC7872325,10.2196/25283,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497350,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7872325,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Anesthesia Simulation Boot Camp-a Decade of Experience Enhancing Self-efficacy in First-year Residents.,"Novice anesthesiology residents must acquire new technical, cognitive, and behavioral skills as they transition into the high-stakes perioperative environment. Simulation-based education improves procedural skill and behavior, and it permits deliberate practice with feedback; exposure to uncommon, high-consequence events; assessment; reproducibility; and zero risk to patients. We introduced a 5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) in 2006 for first-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s) and report over a decade of experience assessing its impact on self-efficacy, value, feasibility, and sustainability. All CA-1s in our residency program participated in the SBC as part of orientation. Participants completed 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with a private debriefing session from an attending anesthesiologist in our simulation center. We measured their self-reported confidence, which we report as self-efficacy (SE), the belief in one's own ability to successfully execute a skill or behavior necessary for a desired outcome, for 25 basic anesthesia skills before and after course completion. Participants also completed a postcourse evaluation. Of the 281 CA-1s who participated in the course from 2006 to 2016, we collected data on 267 (95%). SE improved over the course of SBC for all 25 individual skills (<i>P</i> < .001) and remained stable over the decade-long period of study. Univariate analysis revealed a strong association between increased SE and male sex (<i>P</i> < .001), video gaming experience (<i>P</i> < .001), and completion of a prior residency (<i>P</i> = .018). Males were also more likely to report video gaming experience (<i>P</i> < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that although women had lower SE than did men, they had a greater increase in SE attributed to participation in SBC (<i>P</i> = .041). Participants strongly agreed SBC was a realistic and nonjudgmental learning tool, built confidence, and should be mandatory. Most comments were positive, reflecting overall satisfaction with SBC. SBC increases SE, is feasible, valuable to participants, and sustainable with remarkably consistency over the study period.","Miller Christina, Jackson Eric, Lee Benjamin, Gottschalk Allan, Schiavi Adam",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2020,33447652,PMC7792580,10.46374/volxxii-issue4-schiavi,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33447652,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792580,TRUE,"5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) with 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with private debriefing from an attending anesthesiologist",First-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s),"Increased self-efficacy for basic anesthesia skills, improved confidence, and enhanced transition into the perioperative environment",TRUE,"5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) with 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with a private debriefing session from an attending anesthesiologist",first-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s),"improved self-efficacy, value, feasibility, and sustainability"
Perioperative mobile application for mothers undergoing Cesarean delivery: a prospective cohort study on patient engagement.,"Giving birth is the most common reason for hospital admission, with Cesarean delivery being the most frequently performed inpatient surgery. Through a needs assessment and iterative design process involving patients and obstetric anesthesiologists, we previously developed a mobile application, C-Care, for patients undergoing Cesarean delivery. The focus of C-Care is perioperative education and self-monitoring of potential anesthetic complications. This study aimed to obtain feedback on patient engagement with C-Care. We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients ≥ 18 yr (n = 36) undergoing elective Cesarean delivery. Anonymous usage data were recorded for 30 days. On postoperative days 1-5, participants received daily self-monitoring questionnaires within C-Care. Fourteen days after surgery, participants received an online survey regarding satisfaction and use of C-Care. Thirty-five out of 36 participants visited the application after orientation, with a median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of 32 [31-36] yr. Each participant visited the application a median of 15 [9-31] times over 30 days and completed a median of 3 [2-4] out of five self-monitoring questionnaires. Each participant viewed a median of 4 [2-7] out of eight education topics, with the most viewed patient education topics being ""Controlling Pain"" and ""The First Few Days"". Visits to the application were highest in the first week postpartum.

Life-threatening airway obstruction caused by angioedema in a morbidly obese postoperative patient: a case report.,"We report a case of a morbidly obese patient who developed life-threatening airway obstruction due to angioedema. A 50-year-old Japanese morbidly obese female was treated with enalapril for 10 years, with no history of angioedema. After 3 h of completion of breast cancer resection under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, she developed airway obstruction and respiratory arrest. Her oral cavity was occupied with a swollen tongue. It was extremely difficult to determine the airway anatomical orientation although tracheal intubation was attempted using a videolaryngoscope. At this time, she probably started gasping respiration, which generated a faint bubble and revealed a possible airway. Her airway was established using a tracheal tube without confirming the glottis or the vocal cord. Angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is rare; however, once it occurs, it can be potentially life threatening, especially for patients with possible difficult airway. Considering the risk-benefit ratio, we must be careful in administering ACE inhibitor therapy in morbidly obese patients.","Konda Makiko, Inoue Satoki, Naito Yusuke, Egawa Junji, Kawaguchi Masahiko",JA clinical reports,2021,33398469,PMC7782656,10.1186/s40981-020-00408-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33398469,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7782656,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Protective action of the ginsenoside Rh3 in a rat myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury model by inhibition of apoptosis induced via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/caspase-3 signaling.,"To investigate the protective effects of the ginsenoside Rh3 on rats subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) via its impact on caspase-3 and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Fifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly categorized into the MIR group (MY group, n = 5), sham surgery group (SS group, n = 5), and ginsenoside Rh3 group (GR group, n = 5). The MY group exhibited the largest myocardial infarctions compared with the GR and SS groups. The GR group exhibited significantly higher cell viability of cardiomyocytes and significantly decreased apoptosis compared with the MY group. Fibrils of infarcted tissue in the GR group were disordered but less swollen, with a more organized fibril orientation than those in the MY group. The GR group showed reduced p-p38 MAPK protein and caspase-3 mRNA expression levels compared with the MY and SS groups. Rh3 significantly improved myocardial necrosis and caspase-3 levels in myocardial tissues by suppressing the p38 MAPK pathway, thereby inhibiting caspase-3 involvement in apoptosis. Thus, Rh3 was effective in inhibiting the escalated apoptotic pathway in myocardial infarction and can potentially serve as a useful therapeutic agent to rescue myocardial infarction.","Cao Liexiang, Gao Yi, Zhu Jinqiang, Zhang Jinbo, Dong Meiping, Mao Yi",The Journal of international medical research,2020,33284724,PMC7724424,10.1177/0300060520969090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33284724,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7724424,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Documenting Social Media Engagement as Scholarship: A New Model for Assessing Academic Accomplishment for the Health Professions.,"The traditional model of promotion and tenure in the health professions relies heavily on formal scholarship through teaching, research, and service. Institutions consider how much weight to give activities in each of these areas and determine a threshold for advancement. With the emergence of social media, scholars can engage wider audiences in creative ways and have a broader impact. Conventional metrics like the h-index do not account for social media impact. Social media engagement is poorly represented in most curricula vitae (CV) and therefore is undervalued in promotion and tenure reviews. The objective was to develop crowdsourced guidelines for documenting social media scholarship. These guidelines aimed to provide a structure for documenting a scholar's general impact on social media, as well as methods of documenting individual social media contributions exemplifying innovation, education, mentorship, advocacy, and dissemination. To create unifying guidelines, we created a crowdsourced process that capitalized on the strengths of social media and generated a case example of successful use of the medium for academic collaboration. The primary author created a draft of the guidelines and then sought input from users on Twitter via a publicly accessible Google Document. There was no limitation on who could provide input and the work was done in a democratic, collaborative fashion. Contributors edited the draft over a period of 1 week (September 12-18, 2020). The primary and secondary authors then revised the draft to make it more concise. The guidelines and manuscript were then distributed to the contributors for edits and adopted by the group. All contributors were given the opportunity to serve as coauthors on the publication and were told upfront that authorship would depend on whether they were able to document the ways in which they met the 4 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship criteria. We developed 2 sets of guidelines: Guidelines for Listing All Social Media Scholarship Under Public Scholarship (in Research/Scholarship Section of CV) and Guidelines for Listing Social Media Scholarship Under Research, Teaching, and Service Sections of CV. Institutions can choose which set fits their existing CV format. With more uniformity, scholars can better represent the full scope and impact of their work. These guidelines are not intended to dictate how individual institutions should weigh social media contributions within promotion and tenure cases. Instead, by providing an initial set of guidelines, we hope to provide scholars and their institutions with a common format and language to document social media scholarship.","Acquaviva Kimberly D, Mugele Josh, Abadilla Natasha, Adamson Tyler, Bernstein Samantha L, Bhayani Rakhee K, Büchi Annina Elisabeth, Burbage Darcy, Carroll Christopher L, Davis Samantha P, Dhawan Natasha, Eaton Alice, English Kim, Grier Jennifer T, Gurney Mary K, Hahn Emily S, Haq Heather, Huang Brendan, Jain Shikha, Jun Jin, Kerr Wesley T, Keyes Timothy, Kirby Amelia R, Leary Marion, Marr Mollie, Major Ajay, Meisel Jason V, Petersen Erika A, Raguan Barak, Rhodes Allison, Rupert Deborah D, Sam-Agudu Nadia A, Saul Naledi, Shah Jarna R, Sheldon Lisa Kennedy, Sinclair Christian T, Spencer Kerry, Strand Natalie H, Streed Carl G, Trudell Avery M",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,33263554,PMC7744266,10.2196/25070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33263554,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7744266,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Methods of Orienting New Anesthesiology Residents to the Operating Room Environment: A National Survey of Residency Program Directors.,"The initial weeks of clinical anesthesiology are a formative period for new residents. Trainees may be clinically educated by a variety of individuals, and introductory didactic structure likely differs between institutions. This study was undertaken to define current orientation practices in US anesthesiology residency programs. A survey was created using Qualtrics© software and distributed to all US anesthesiology residency program directors through the Society of Academic Associations of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine email newsletter and through direct email to program directors. Fifty-six unique survey responses were received of 156 total programs. Eighty-nine percent of programs with an integrated intern year begin anesthesia-related orientation before the first year of clinical anesthesiology. Sixty-three percent of programs pair trainees with more than one specific individual during orientation. Programs most frequently pair trainees with anesthesiologists (75%) and/or senior residents (70%). Forty-six percent maintain this pairing for 4 weeks and 30% for 6 weeks or longer. Forty-three percent provide education on teaching practices to trainers. Introductory didactics last a median of 30 hours. Programs may blend lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, and/or checklists into a cohesive introductory curriculum. Fifty-six percent begin call responsibilities in the sixth week of orientation or later. Orientation practices for clinical anesthesia training vary across residency programs in the United States. We hope this information will help program directors compare their orientation practices to other programs and identify best practices and potentially useful variations.","Huang Jeffrey, Licatino Lauren K, Long Timothy R",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2020,33225015,PMC7664602,10.46374/volxxii-issue3-Licatino,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33225015,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664602,TRUE,"Orientation practices including pairing trainees with anesthesiologists/senior residents, introductory didactics (lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, checklists), and gradual introduction to call responsibilities",New anesthesiology residents,Identifying best practices and potentially useful variations in orientation to help program directors improve their orientation practices,TRUE,"Programs may blend lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, and/or checklists into a cohesive introductory curriculum.

Coaching for the pediatric anesthesiologist: Becoming our best selves.,"Anesthesiologists must balance demanding clinical workloads with career development goals. Leadership, conflict management, and other skills can improve medical outcomes, reduce stress at work, and increase career satisfaction. However, Medicine in general and Anesthesiology in particular have not traditionally emphasized physician growth in these areas. Coaching utilizes concepts from psychology, adult learning, and adult development theory to support an individual in personal and professional growth through inquiry, reflection, and shared discovery. This manuscript reviews the history and evidence basis for coaching, differentiates coaching from traditional mentorship, and presents some constructs of coaching and working with a coach. An example of a successful pilot program to disseminate coaching skills and support leadership growth among anesthesiologists, the Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia, is described.","Schwartz Jamie McElrath, Wittkugel Eric, Markowitz Scott D, Lee Jennifer K, Deutsch Nina",Paediatric anaesthesia,2021,33070377,,10.1111/pan.14041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070377,,TRUE,"Coaching program focused on leadership, conflict management, and professional development skills","Pediatric anesthesiologists, particularly through the Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia","Improved medical outcomes, reduced workplace stress, increased career satisfaction, and enhanced leadership growth",TRUE,"Coaching utilizing concepts from psychology, adult learning, and adult development theory to support an individual in personal and professional growth through inquiry, reflection, and shared discovery.",Pediatric anesthesiologists,"Improved medical outcomes, reduced stress at work, increased career satisfaction, and support leadership growth among anesthesiologists."
"Changes in health insurance coverage, access to care, and health services utilization by sexual minority status in the United States, 2013-2018.","To examine the changes in health insurance coverage, access to care, and health services utilization among nonelderly sexual minority and heterosexual adults between pooled years 2013-2014 and 2017-2018. Data on 3223 sexual minorities (lesbians, gay men, bisexual individuals, and other nonheterosexual populations) and 86 181 heterosexuals aged 18-64 years were obtained from the 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018 National Health Interview Surveys. Unadjusted and regression-adjusted estimates compared changes in health insurance status, access to care, and health services utilization for nonelderly adults by sexual minority status. Regression-adjusted changes were obtained from logistic regression models controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Uninsurance declined for both sexual minority adults (5 percentage points, P < .05) and heterosexual adults (2.5 percentage points, P < .001) between 2013-2014 and 2017-2018. Reductions in uninsurance for sexual minority and heterosexual adults were associated with increases in Medicaid coverage. Sexual minority and heterosexual adults were also less likely to report unmet medical care in 2017-2018 compared with 2013-2014. Low-income adults (regardless of sexual minority status) experienced relatively large increases in Medicaid coverage and substantial improvements in access to care over the study period. The gains in coverage and access to care across the study period were generally similar for heterosexual and sexual minority adults. Sexual minority and heterosexual adults have experienced improvements in health insurance coverage and access to care in recent years. Ongoing health equity research and public health initiatives should continue to monitor health care access and the potential benefits of recent health insurance expansions by sexual orientation and sexual minority status when possible.","Gonzales Gilbert, Henning-Smith Carrie, Ehrenfeld Jesse M",Health services research,2021,33000467,PMC7968940,10.1111/1475-6773.13567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33000467,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968940,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
An Advanced Boot Camp for Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellows.,"Managing pediatric crises necessitates the acquisition of unique skills and confidence in its execution. Our aim was to develop and assess a curriculum based on the constructivist learning environment to enhance learning, orientation, and preparation of graduating pediatric anesthesiology fellows. Fifty pediatric anesthesiology fellows from 9 academic institutions in the United States were recruited for an advanced boot camp over a 2-year period. Training stations were developed using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions. The curriculum was evaluated using an anonymous survey that assessed knowledge, self-confidence, appropriateness of case-scenario complexity, and usefulness for transitioning into an independent practitioner on a Likert scale (<i>1 = strongly disagree</i> to <i>5 = strongly agree</i>). Data points were expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Ninety-eight percent of the fellows completed a survey. Fellow perceptions of the advanced boot camp was positive. The median scores (IQR) for knowledge, self-confidence, appropriateness of case complexity, and usefulness for transition in 2017 were 5 (3,5), 4.5 (3,5), 5 (3,5), and 5 (3,5), respectively, and 5 (3,5), 4.5 (3,5), 5 (4,5), and 5 (3,5), respectively, in 2018. The IQR in the assessment for an appropriate level of complexity for their level of training, narrowed in 2018 (4,5), when compared with 2017 (3,5). Fellow responses support the idea that the advanced boot camp provided tools and strategies for their transition. A narrowed IQR regarding the appropriate level of complexity of scenarios in 2018, when compared with 2017, might suggest an improvement in the curriculum.","Patel Shivani M, Singh Devika, Hunsberger Joann B, Lockman Justin L, Taneja Pravin A, Gurnaney Harshad G, Corridore Marco, Ambardekar Aditee P, Borzova Vera V, Vecchione Tricia M, Lockhart Thomas J, Lim Doyle J, Shay Joanne E, Black Stephanie A, Njoku Dolores B",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2020,32964069,PMC7489476,10.46374/volxxii-issue2-njoku,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32964069,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7489476,TRUE,"Advanced boot camp curriculum using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions",Pediatric anesthesiology fellows,"Enhanced learning, orientation, and preparation for transitioning into independent practitioners",TRUE,"An advanced boot camp using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions",Graduating pediatric anesthesiology fellows,"Enhanced learning, orientation, and preparation for transitioning into an independent practitioner"
Mapping the trigeminal root entry zone and its pontine fibre distribution patterns.,"Recently, an additional trigeminothalamic tract - the dorsal trigeminothalamic tract - has been described in human brainstems by our group next to the known ventral trigeminothalamic tract. As various elements of the trigeminal system are known to be organised in a somatotopic fashion, the question arose whether the fibres within the trigeminal root show specific distributions patterns in their contribution to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract specifically. This study investigated the arrangement of the fibres in the trigeminal root by combining various imaging methods in the pons of 11 post-mortem specimens. The pons were investigated by polarised light imaging (PLI) (n = 4; to quantify fibre orientation; 100 µm interslice distance), histochemical staining methods (n = 3; to visualise the internal myeloarchitecture; 60 µm) and ultra-high field, post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 4; for tractography; 500 µm interslice distance). This study shows that the fibres, from the point where the trigeminal root enters the brainstem, are distinctly arranged by their contribution to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract. This finding is supported by both post-mortem, ultra-high dMRI and different light microscopy techniques. The data from this study suggest that the fibres in the superior half of the root contribute mainly to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract, whereas the fibres in the inferior half mainly contribute to the dorsal trigeminothalamic tract. Such a somatotopic organisation could possibly create new insights into the anatomical origin of trigeminal neuralgia and the clinical relevance of this somatotopic organisation should therefore be further explored.","Guberinic Alis, Souverein Veerle, Volkers Ruben, van Cappellen van Walsum Anne-Marie, Vissers Kris Cp, Mollink Jeroen, Henssen Dylan Jha",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,2020,32962405,PMC7691629,10.1177/0333102420959796,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32962405,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7691629,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Structure of the Plasmodium falciparum PfSERA5 pseudo-zymogen.,"PfSERA5, a significantly abundant protein present within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and essential for normal growth during the blood-stage life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, displays structural similarity to many other cysteine proteases. However, PfSERA5 does not exhibit any detectable protease activity and therefore the role of the PfSERA5 papain-like domain (PfSERA5E), thought to remain bound to its cognate prodomain, remains unknown. In this study, we present a revised structure of the central PfSERA5E domain at a resolution of 1.2 Å, and the first structure of the ""zymogen"" of this papain-like domain including its cognate prodomain (PfSERA5PE) to 2.2 Å resolution. PfSERA5PE is somewhat structurally similar to that of other known proenzymes, retaining the conserved overall folding and orientation of the prodomain through, and occluding, the archetypal papain-like catalytic triad ""active-site"" cleft, in the same reverse direction as conventional prodomains. Our findings are congruent with previously identified structures of PfSERA5E and of similar ""zymogens"" and provide a foundation for further investigation into the function of PfSERA5.","Smith Nicholas A, Clarke Oliver B, Lee Mihwa, Hodder Anthony N, Smith Brian J",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2020,32955133,PMC7586913,10.1002/pro.3956,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32955133,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7586913,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Specific Anteversion of Cup and Combined Anteversion for Total Hip Arthroplasty Using Lateral Approach.,"To determine the implant orientation, especially the combined anteversion measurements in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using lateral approach, and to compare with implant orientation using posterior-lateral (P-L) approach. The secondary goal was to identify the factors associated with implant orientation. Five hundred and one patients (545 hips) who underwent primary THA with the modified Hardinge approach between January 2016 and November 2019 by one senior surgeon in our department in a retrospective study were followed up. A survey to inquire about the history of dislocation of the hip after THA was designed and responses were gathered by telephone, WeChat software, and outpatient follow-up. The mean age of the patients was 61.97 ± 11.72 years, and there were 254 males and 247 females. The average follow-up time was 25.2 ± 13.7 months (range, 3.2-49.7 months). Among the patients who were followed up, 97 patients (104 hips) underwent computed tomography (CT) scans from L<sub>4</sub> to the tuberosity of the tibia. The implant orientation, including the anteversion and inclination of the cup, anteversion of the stem, combined anteversion, and pelvic tilt were measured based on CT scans of these patients. The results were compared with the implant orientation reported in previous reports measured by CT. Factors that may be associated with implant orientation were investigated, including the patient's age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diagnosis; size of the cup; diameter of the femoral head component; and pelvic tilt. Data and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0. No cases of dislocation were found in the 501 patients (545 hips) who underwent primary THA during this period. The mean inclination and anteversion of the cups were 38.83° ± 5.04° (24.5°-53.1°) and 9.26° ± 11.19° (-15°-48°), respectively. The mean anteversion of the stem was 13.83° ± 10.7° (-10.2°-42.3°). The combined anteversion was 23.1° ± 13.4° (-7.4°-54.6°). Compared with the reported combined anteversion and anteversion of the cup, the mean anteversion of the cup and combined anteversion using the lateral approach were much lower than the reported values in the literature using the P-L approach. Pelvic tilt was found to be the only independent factor for cup anteversion. Factors including age, sex, BMI, diagnosis, cup size, and diameter of the femoral head component were not associated with implant orientation. THA using the lateral approach yields smaller cup anteversion and combined anteversion values than using the P-L approach. Pelvic tilt is the only predictor for cup anteversion.","Li Li, Zhang Yu, Lin Yuan-Yuan, Li Zhen-Xing, Chen Liang, Chen Dao-Sen, Fan Pei",Orthopaedic surgery,2020,32924261,PMC7767786,10.1111/os.12790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32924261,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7767786,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Simple and Effective Primary Assessment of Emergency Patients in a COVID-19 Outbreak Area: A Retrospective, Observational Study.","The rapid spread of COVID-19 has expanded into a pandemic, for which the main containment strategies to reduce transmission are social distancing and isolation of ill persons. Thousands of medical staff have been infected worldwide. Coronavirus testing kits have been in short supply, and early diagnostic reagents did not have high sensitivity. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients requiring emergency surgery in a COVID-19 outbreak area. We assessed medical data regarding all patients who underwent emergency surgery at the main campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 23, 2020, to February 15, 2020. We classified patients based on suspicion of COVID-19 infection (suspected vs not suspected) before they were admitted to the operating room. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. Outcomes included the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 infection and length of stay, which were followed until March 25, 2020. Among the 88 emergency patients included in this study, the mean age was 37 years. Twenty-five patients presented with abnormalities observed on chest CT scans and 16 presented with fever. The median wait time for surgery was one day. The median preparation time and median time until short orientation memory concentration test (SOMCT) recovery from anesthesia were 44.0 min and 23.0 min, respectively. The median postoperative length of stay was five days. Compared with patients not suspected of COVID-19 infection, six patients were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in the suspected group. No health care workers were infected during this study period. Simple identification using temperature screening of patients, respiratory symptoms, and chest CT scans before being admitted for emergency surgery was rapid and effective. Shortened contact times might reduce the risk of infection.

Distribution of C-arm projections in native and bioprosthetic aortic valves cusps: Implication for BASILICA procedures.,"We sought to document aortic cusps fluoroscopic projections and their distributions using leaflet alignment which is a novel concept to optimize visualization of leaflets and for guiding BASILICA (bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent coronary artery obstruction) and determine whether these projections were feasible in catheter laboratory. Optimal fluoroscopic projections of aortic valve cusps have not been well described. A total of 128 pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (pre-TAVR) computed tomographies (CT) (72 native valves and 56 bioprosthetic surgical valves) were analyzed. Using CT software (3Mensio, Pie medical imaging, the Netherlands), leaflet alignment was performed and the feasibility of these angles, which were defined as rate of obtainable with efforts (within LAO/RAO of 85° and CRA/CAU of 50°) were evaluated. High feasibility was seen in right coronary cusp (RCC) front view (100%) and left coronary cusp (LCC) side view (99.2%), followed by noncoronary cusp side view (95.3%). In contrast, low feasibility of RCC side view (7.8%) and LCC front view (47.6%) was observed. No statistical differences were seen between the distribution of native valves and bioprosthetic surgical valves. With patient/table tilt of 20°LAO and 10°CRA, the feasibility of RCC side view and LCC front view increased to 43.7 and 85.2%, respectively. Distributions of each cusp's leaflet alignment follows ""sigmoid curve"" which can provide better understanding of aortic valve cusp orientation in TAVR and BASILICA. RCC side view used in right cusp BASILICA is commonly unachievable in catheter laboratory and may improve with patient/table tilt.","Komatsu Ikki, Tang Gilbert H L, Leipsic Jonathon, Webb John G, Blanke Philipp, Mackensen G Burkhard, Kitamura Mitsunobu, Wolak Arik, Don Creighton W, McCabe James M, Rumer Christopher, Tan Christina W, Levin Dmitry B, Ramos Mario, Aldea Gabriel S, Reisman Mark, Wijeysundera Harindra C, Radhakrishnan Sam, Sathananthan Janarthanan, Piazza Nicolo, Kornowski Ran, Abdel-Wahab Mohamed, Dvir Danny",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2021,32894804,,10.1002/ccd.29224,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32894804,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Eighty-five patients with mTBI underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on average 8 months post-injury and patients' outcome was assessed at the time of imaging using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). Additionally, 30 age-matched patients with extracranial orthopedic injuries were used as control subjects. Voxel-wise analysis of the data was performed using a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach and differences in microstructural metrics between groups were investigated. Further, the susceptibility of the abnormalities to specific fiber orientations was investigated by analyzing the first eigenvector of the diffusion tensor in the voxels with significant differences. We found significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in patients with mTBI compared with control subjects, whereas no significant differences were observed in axial diffusivity (AD) between the groups. The differences were present bilaterally in several WM regions and correlated with outcome. Moreover, multiple clusters were found in the principal fiber orientations of the significant voxels in anisotropy, and similar orientation patterns were found for the diffusivity metrics. These directional clusters correlated with patients' functional outcome. Our study showed that mTBI is associated with WM changes at the chronic stage and these alterations occur in several WM regions. In addition, several significant clusters of WM alterations in specific fiber orientations were found and these clusters were associated with outcome.","Mohammadian Mehrbod, Roine Timo, Hirvonen Jussi, Kurki Timo, Posti Jussi P, Katila Ari J, Takala Riikka S K, Tallus Jussi, Maanpää Henna-Riikka, Frantzén Janek, Hutchinson Peter J, Newcombe Virginia F, Menon David K, Tenovuo Olli",Journal of neurotrauma,2020,32689872,,10.1089/neu.2020.7081,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32689872,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Rock of Gibraltar: The Value of Mentorship in the Early Years (Dr. Virginia Apgar and Dr. Ralph Waters).,"Behind every successful physician there are mentors to light the path. Ralph Waters, founder of the anesthesiology residency at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was an instrumental part of Virginia Apgar's success; his support of her education and promotion of her professional endeavors proved to shape the medical powerhouse that Apgar would become. In this article, we learn about the professional and personal relationship between Waters and Apgar through personal correspondence from the Ralph Waters Collection at University of Wisconsin Archives, scientific publications, and meeting records. Through his support of her career, she was able to achieve success despite the Great Depression, World War II, and the novelty of being a woman in medicine. In her career, Apgar became the first female full professor at Columbia University, designed and implemented the Apgar score, and led the Division of Congenital Malformations at the March of Dimes among many other accomplishments. Though they lived half of a country apart in Wisconsin and in New York, the mentor and mentee bridged the gap in geography through regular correspondence, American Society of Anesthetists (now American Society of Anesthesiologists) meetings (where Waters served as president and Apgar as treasurer), and exchange of trainees between the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Columbia University. Apgar revealed herself to be a persistent, hardworking, intelligent, and passionate academic physician - the perfect pupil for Waters.

Comparison of Ultrasonography Features and K-TIRADS for Isthmic and Lobar Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas: A Single-Center Study.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to compare ultrasonography (US) features and the Korean-Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS) categories for diagnosing isthmic and lobar papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). <b>Methods:</b> From January 2009 to December 2012, 163 patients who underwent thyroid surgery and were confirmed with a post-operative histopathological diagnosis of isthmic PTC were retrospectively included. Fifty-nine patients were excluded because their tumor size was <0.5 cm or because of other reasons. The control group comprised of 145 patients who underwent thyroid surgery from January to April 2013 for a classic type of PTC, with the largest diameter being ≥ 0.5 cm and located in the thyroid lobe. A single radiologist retrospectively reviewed the US features and K-TIRADS categories of each nodule using a picture archiving and communication system. <b>Results:</b> Among 104 patients with isthmic PTC, 95 and 9 had primary and secondary cancers, respectively. On the other hand, all 145 patients with lobar PTC had primary cancers. Isthmic PTC showed a lower prevalence of non-parallel orientation than lobar PTC (23.1 and 71%). Nodule orientation was the only US feature statistically different between the two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in patient age, sex, nodule size, composition, echogenicity, microcalcification, spiculated/microlobulated margin, and K-TIRADS category between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> K-TIRADS may be useful in the diagnosis of both isthmic and lobar PTC.","Lee Yoo Jin, Kim Dong Wook, Shin Gi Won, Park Jin Young, Choo Hye Jung, Park Ha Kyoung, Ha Tae Kwun, Kim Do Hun, Jung Soo Jin, Park Ji Sun, Moon Sung Ho, Ahn Ki Jung, Baek Hye Jin",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,32582025,PMC7287017,10.3389/fendo.2020.00328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32582025,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7287017,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Incoming Interns Recognize Inadequate Physical Examination as a Cause of Patient Harm.,"As providers of a large portion of the care delivered at academic health centers, medical trainees have a unique perspective on medical error. Despite data suggesting that errors in physical examination (PE) can lead to adverse patient events, we are not aware of previous studies exploring medical trainee perceptions of the relationship between patient harm and inadequate PE. We investigated whether first-year residents at a large tertiary care academic medical center perceive inadequate PE as a cause of adverse patient events. As part of a larger survey given to incoming interns at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital orientation (2014-2018), the authors examined the perceptions of inadequate PE and adverse patient events. We also examined other details related to PE educational experiences and self-reported PE proficiency. The survey was developed a priori by the authors and assessed for face validity by expert faculty. Ninety-eight percent of respondents (695/706) reported that inadequate PE leads to adverse patient events. Seventy percent (492/706) believe that inadequate PE causes adverse events in up to 10% of all patient encounters, and 30% (214/706) reported that inadequate PE causes adverse events in greater than 10% of patient encounters. Forty-five percent of surveyed interns (319/715) had witnessed a patient safety issue as a result of an inadequate PE. Only 2% of surveyed interns (11/706) did not think patients experience adverse events because of inadequate PEs. Ninety percent of surveyed interns (643/712) reported feeling proficient in performing PE. From 2015 to 2018, 80% (486/604) indicated that they received ""just enough"" PE education. Nearly all incoming interns surveyed at our institution believe that inadequate PE leads to adverse patient events, and 45% have witnessed an adverse patient event due to inadequate PE. We urge clinicians, educators, and health care administrators to consider enhanced PE skills training as an important and viable approach to medical error reduction, and as such, we propose a 5-pronged intervention for improvement, including a redesign of PE curricula, development of checklist-based assessment methods, ongoing skills training and assessment of physicians-in-practice, rigorous study of PE maneuvers, and research into whether enhanced PE skills improve patient outcomes.","Russo Stefani, Berg Katherine, Davis Joshua, Davis Robyn, Riesenberg Lee Ann, Morgan Charity, Chambers Lucas, Berg Dale",Journal of medical education and curricular development,2020,32577530,PMC7288807,10.1177/2382120520928993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32577530,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7288807,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Hand placement during chest compressions in parturients: a pilot study to identify the location of the left ventricle using transthoracic echocardiography.,"Current guidelines for maternal cardiopulmonary resuscitation recommend the hands be placed on the lower half of the sternum for compressions. We sought to evaluate the effect of the gravid uterus and left uterine displacement on the position of the left ventricle (LV) using transthoracic echocardiography. We enrolled 20 women in the third trimester of a singleton pregnancy. Transthoracic echocardiography images in the supine and left lateral position, using a 30° wedge, were acquired. Parasternal long and short axis views of the LV were obtained at the lower half of the sternum and at the ideal imaging window (best image of mid-LV at 90° transducer orientation) The primary aim was to evaluate the distance between the distal end of the xiphoid and the location of the best imaging window of the LV. The cohort included women without prior anatomical cardiac disease. The LV was best visualized 5.8 (±2) cm cranial to the distal end of the xiphoid in the supine position and 6.1 (±2) cm in the lateral position (P=0.6), using the left parasternal border as a reference. No lateral cardiac displacement was evidenced in either position. This pilot study used transthoracic echocardiography to document the position of the LV during the third trimester of pregnancy. The LV was located approximately 6 cm cranial to the distal tip of the xiphoid process. Further validation is required before recommending changes in hand placement during maternal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Delgado C, Dawson K, Schwaegler B, Zachariah R, Einav S, Bollag L",International journal of obstetric anesthesia,2020,32574884,,10.1016/j.ijoa.2020.05.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32574884,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

"A comparison of nasogastric tube insertion by SORT maneuver (sniffing position, NGT orientation, contralateral rotation, and twisting movement) versus neck flexion lateral pressure in critically ill patients admitted to ICU: a prospective randomized clinical trial.","Although many techniques have been introduced to facilitate nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion using anatomic landmarks and a group of devices, there is a lack of general consensus regarding a standard method. The current study purposed to investigate if SORT maneuver (sniffing position, NGT orientation, contralateral rotation, and twisting movement) increases the success rate of NGT correct placement versus neck flexion lateral pressure (NFLP) method. A randomized controlled trial study was conducted in two university affiliated intensive care units (tertiary referral center). Three hundred and ninety-six critically ill patients older than 18 years of age were randomly divided into SORT (n = 200) and NFLP (n = 196) groups. The technique was classified as ""failed"" after the third unsuccessful attempt. Patient characteristics, success rate for the first attempt, time required for the successful first attempt and overall successful insertion time, various complications including kinking, coiling and bleeding and ease of insertion were noted as main outcomes measured. Ease of insertion was significantly better in the SORT group compared to the NFLP group (P < 0.001). The number of failed attempts was significantly higher in the NFLP group (7.5%) vs the SORT group (3.0%) (P = 0.046). The pattern of complications was not different between two study groups (P = 0.242). The odds of stage II (odds ratio (OR) = 49.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 25.2 to 98.6), stage III (OR = 67.1; 95% CI 14.9 to 302.8)) and stage IV (OR = 11.8; 95% CI 3.4 to 41.2) ease of insertion were much higher in NFLP compared to SORT group, after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). The odds of failure was not significantly different in NFLP group compared to SORT group (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 0.85 to 6.3), after adjusting for age and BMI. SORT technique may be considered as a promising method for successful NGT insertions in critically ill patients. However, more trials are needed to confirm the results of this study. The decision must account for individual patient and clinical factors and the operator's experience and preference.

Women anesthesiologists' journeys to academic leadership: a constructivist grounded theory-inspired study.,"Women continue to be underrepresented in academic anesthesiology, especially in leadership positions. Possible reasons for this gender disparity include family responsibilities, inadequate mentorship, lack of desire for leadership, the leaky pipeline effect (i.e., attrition of women physicians over the course of their career trajectories), and discrimination. Our objective was to understand the lived experiences of Canadian anesthesiologists in leadership positions. In this constructivist grounded theory-inspired study, we used purposeful sampling to identify women anesthesiologists in leadership positions at one Canadian institution. Each participant underwent a one-on-one semi-structured interview of 40-60 min in length, sampling until theoretical saturation was reached. We included questions about the participant's practice setting, influences on their career, and advice the participant would provide to other women in leadership. We used an iterative approach to theoretical sampling and data analysis. The audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were transcribed and coded. NVivo12 was used for open and axial coding, and cross-referencing. Eight women anesthesiologists were recruited and interviewed. Our iterative process identified four interconnected themes: difficulty internalizing a leadership identity, identifying systemic barriers and biases, dissonance between agentic traits and communal social gender roles, and mentorship as shaping lived experiences. Participants consistently expressed experiencing discrimination, articulated barriers related to family responsibilities and ingrained societal expectations, and discussed how typical leadership traits are applied differently to women and men. Women perceived themselves as more compassionate and communicative than men. Despite these traits, these women have expressed barriers to obtaining mentorship. We identified consistent interconnected themes among the experiences of our sample of women anesthesiologists in academic leadership and found that academic anesthesiology is a gendered profession as experienced by these women leaders. Further research should focus on strategies to remove barriers to participation in academic anesthesiology for women.","Lorello Gianni R, Cil Tulin, Flexman Alana M",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2020,32514695,,10.1007/s12630-020-01735-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32514695,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,Mentorship,Women anesthesiologists in leadership positions at one Canadian institution,"Understanding the lived experiences of Canadian anesthesiologists in leadership positions, identifying systemic barriers and biases, and shaping lived experiences through mentorship"

Burnout Among Women Physicians: a Call to Action.,"The purposes of this discussion are to describe what is known about burnout among women physicians and identify contributing factors, categories of impact, and methods for mitigating the phenomenon. The authors conclude with current gaps in research. Although there are a lack of investigations analyzing and reporting physician burnout data by gender, there is evidence to suggest that women physicians experience stress and burnout differently than their men counterparts. Women physicians are more likely to face gender discrimination, gender biases, deferred personal life decisions, and barriers to professional advancement, all of which may contribute to burnout. Interventions specific to preventing physician burnout in women should include (1) addressing barriers to career satisfaction, work life integration, and mental health; (2) identification and reduction of gender and maternal bias; (3) mentorship and sponsorship opportunities; (4) family leave, lactation, and child care policies and support. In addition, gaps in research must be addressed in an effort to inform best practices for measuring and addressing burnout among women physicians.","Chesak Sherry S, Cutshall Susanne, Anderson Alexandra, Pulos Bridget, Moeschler Susan, Bhagra Anjali",Current cardiology reports,2020,32472336,,10.1007/s11886-020-01300-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32472336,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

To determine SH prevalence in a national sample of French medical students and to validate a theoretical model explaining SH causes and its impact of mental health. The study is a cross-sectional observational epidemiological national study. SH was defined according to the French legal definition. We further explored other discriminations and their potential association with impaired mental health in medical students. Mental health was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety & Depression scale, psychotropic drug consumption and psychotherapy follow-up. A Structured Equation Modeling was carried out to confirm our theoretical model. 2003 participants were recruited. SH was reported by 15.7% of the participants (19.8% of women and 5.2% of men). The SEM model showed good fit (RMSEA=0.024, CFI=0.90, TLI=0.87, WRMR=1.165). SH was associated with risk factors such as feminine gender and surgical and anesthesiology specialties. SH was also associated with exposure to discriminations based on the specialty choice and sexual orientation. SH was associated with impaired mental health. French medical student women reported similar rates of SH than other working women, suggesting that SH prevention programs are needed in French hospitals. Surgery and anesthesiology should be targeted in priority. The prevention programs should also target other discriminations and should be evaluated in terms of potential mental health improvement.","Duba A, Messiaen M, Boulangeat C, Boucekine M, Bourbon A, Viprey M, Auquier P, Lançon C, Boyer L, Fond G",Journal of affective disorders,2020,32469816,,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32469816,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Paravertebral block: anatomy and relevant safety issues.,"Paravertebral block, especially thoracic paravertebral block, is an effective regional anesthetic technique that can provide significant analgesia for numerous surgical procedures, including breast surgery, pulmonary surgery, and herniorrhaphy. The technique, although straightforward, is not devoid of potential adverse effects. Proper anatomic knowledge and adequate technique may help decrease the risk of these effects. In this brief discourse, we discuss the anatomy and technical aspects of paravertebral blocks and emphasize the importance of appropriate needle manipulation in order to minimize the risk of complications. We propose that, when using a landmark-based approach, limiting medial and lateral needle orientation and implementing caudal (rather than cephalad) needle redirection may provide an extra margin of safety when performing this technique. Likewise, recognizing a target that is not in close proximity to the neurovascular bundle when using ultrasound guidance may be beneficial.","Ardon Alberto E, Lee Justin, Franco Carlo D, Riutort Kevin T, Greengrass Roy A",Korean journal of anesthesiology,2020,32172551,PMC7533185,10.4097/kja.20065,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32172551,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7533185,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Contribution of the Pre-Hospital Blood Lactate Level in the Pre-Hospital Orientation of Septic Shock: The LAPHSUS Study.,"In the pre-hospital setting, the assessment of septic shock severity is essential when determining the optimal initial in-hospital level of care. As clinical signs can be faulted, there is a need for an additional component to enhance the severity assessment and to decide on in-hospital admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in the emergency department (ED). Point-of-care medical devices by yielding blood lactate value since the pre-hospital setting may give an easy and valuable component for the severity assessment and decision-making. The aim of this study is to provide clinical evidence that the pre-hospital blood lactate level predicts the 30-day mortality in patients with septic shock. This trial is a prospective, observational, non-randomised controlled study. A total of 1,000 patients requiring a mobile ICU intervention for septic shock in the pre-hospital setting will be included. Pre-hospital blood lactate levels will not be taken into account to decide patients' treatments and/or ED or ICU admission. In the pre-hospital setting, each patient will benefit from two measurements of the blood lactate level: initial measurement at the first contact, and final measurement at the hospital admission with a specific point-of-care medical device. This study could provide clinical evidence that the pre-hospital blood lactate level predicts the 30-day mortality of patients with septic shock. The results from this study could also prove the utility of the pre-hospital blood lactate level for the triage and early orientation of patients with septic shock.","Jouffroy Romain, Tourtier Jean Pierre, Debaty Guillaume, Bounes Vincent, Gueye-Ngalgou Papa, Vivien Benoit",Turkish journal of anaesthesiology and reanimation,2020,32076681,PMC7001804,10.5152/TJAR.2019.42027,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076681,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7001804,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Pecha Kucha with Part-Task Training Improves Airway Management in Fresh Frozen Cadavers: A Case-Control Observational Study.,"The objective of this study was to ascertain whether the addition of part-task training as a step in Pecha Kucha for fiberoptic tracheal intubation increases the success rate and reduces the complication rate. The residents of the Department of Anesthesiology were initially included in an orientation program. We used the Pecha Kucha method for the presentation of teaching fiberoptic intubation skills. Afterwards the participants were trained in Laerdal® airway management and each participant performed tracheal intubation using the Aintree catheter. The participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 9) received part-task training and group 2 (n = 9) received whole-task training. The tracheal intubation performances of participants were evaluated on fresh frozen cadavers. The number of interventions, incidence of complications, success rate, and optimization maneuver requirements were recorded. Eighteen residents aged between 27 and 33 years were included. All were junior residents with less than 2 years of experience. There was no significant difference in terms of duration of tracheal intubation, complication rates, and optimization maneuvers between the study groups. Six participants could not place the tracheal tube in the last section. The success rates for the part-task group during Aintree and tracheal tube placement were 100 and 66.7%, respectively, whereas the rates were 55.6 and 44.4%, respectively, in whole-task group (p < 0.05). In addition to the Pecha Kucha method in fiberoptic intubation training, simulation-based part-task training appears to increase the success rate and to reduce the complication rate on fresh frozen cadavers.","Saracoglu Kemal Tolga, Yilmaz Mehmet, Turan Ayse Zeynep, Kus Alparslan, Colak Tuncay, Saracoglu Ayten","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",2020,32069469,PMC7768097,10.1159/000506597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32069469,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7768097,TRUE,Pecha Kucha method with part-task training for fiberoptic tracheal intubation,Junior anesthesiology residents with less than 2 years of experience,Increased success rate and reduced complication rate in fiberoptic intubation,TRUE,"Pecha Kucha method for teaching fiberoptic intubation skills, followed by part-task training in Laerdal® airway management",Junior residents of the Department of Anesthesiology with less than 2 years of experience,Increased success rate and reduced complication rate in fiberoptic tracheal intubation
Prevention and Management of Operating Room Fire: An Interprofessional Operating Room Team Simulation Case.,"Operating room (OR) fire can be a devastating and costly event to patients and health care providers. Prevention and effective management of such fires may present difficulties even for experienced OR staff. This simulation involved a 52-year-old man presenting for excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node to be performed under sedation. Participants were expected to identify and manage both contained and uncontained fires resulting from ignition by electrosurgical cautery. We conducted weekly multidisciplinary simulations in the mock OR at Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants included surgery and anesthesiology residents, certified registered nurse anesthetists, registered nurses, and surgical technicians. Participants were unaware of the scenario content. Each 90-minute session was divided into three parts: an orientation (10 minutes), the case with rapid cycle debriefing (65 minutes), and a final debriefing with course evaluations (15 minutes). Equipment consisted of a simulation OR with general surgery supplies, general anesthesia equipment, a high-fidelity Laerdal SimMan 3G simulator, a code cart, a defibrillator, dry ice for smoke effects, and a projector with a fire image. From April to June 2015, 86 participants completed this simulation. Participants reported that the simulation scenario was realistic (80%), was relevant to their clinical practice (93%), changed their practice (82%), and promoted teamwork (80%). Prevention and management of OR fire require collaboration and prompt coordination between anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses. This simulation case scenario was implemented to train multidisciplinary learners in the identification and crisis management of such an event.","Mai Christine L, Wongsirimeteekul Praelada, Petrusa Emil, Minehart Rebecca, Hemingway Maureen, Pian-Smith May, Eromo Ersne, Phitayakorn Roy",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2020,32051852,PMC7012309,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32051852,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012309,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Desflurane is not inferior to sevoflurane in the occurrence of adverse respiratory events during laryngeal mask airway anesthesia: a non-inferiority randomized double-blinded controlled study.,"Compared to sevoflurane, desflurane is less favorable to most anesthesiologists for laryngeal mask airway (LMA) anesthesia because desflurane has a pungent odor. This non-inferiority study aimed to determine whether desflurane is not worse than sevoflurane in triggering airway irritations during general anesthesia using LMA. Patients scheduled for elective surgery under LMA anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane or sevoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. After intravenous fentanyl, lidocaine and propofol administration followed by LMA insertion, 0.5-1.0 MAC of the volatile anesthetic in 50% N2O was maintained throughout the surgery. The primary outcome was the occurrence of perioperative adverse respiratory events. Other outcomes included recovery profiles, hemodynamic changes and postoperative complications. One-hundred and ten patients per group completed the study without any serious complications, lost to follow-up, or protocol deviation. During awake LMA removal, patients in the desflurane group experienced lesser episodes of laryngospasm (risk difference, -7.3%; 95% CI, -12.7% to -1.9%; P=0.009) than those in the sevoflurane group. The emergence time and time to LMA removal were significantly shorter in the desflurane group. The quality of recovery indicated by an ability to self-transfer from bed to bed was significantly better after desflurane anesthesia. No difference between groups was found in a return of orientation and a readiness for post-anesthesia care unit discharge. Desflurane is non-inferior to sevoflurane in the occurrence of laryngospasm at emergence after LMA anesthesia. The superiority of desflurane compared to sevoflurane with regards to respiratory complications requires further investigation.","Pin-On Pathomporn, Leurcharusmee Prangmalee, Tanasungnuchit Suwannee, Srivita Katekanog, Khunwittaya Parichad",Minerva anestesiologica,2020,32013332,,10.23736/S0375-9393.20.14202-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32013332,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Use of gelatin puzzle phantoms to teach medical students isolated ultrasound transducer movements and fundamental concepts.,"Psychomotor skills related to the use of medical ultrasound are a fundamental, but often overlooked component of this ubiquitous medical imaging technology. Although discussions of image production/orientation, sonographic planes, and imaging/scanning techniques are common in existing literature, these discussions rarely address practical skills related to these basic concepts. The cognitive load of transducer movements and machine operation, in conjunction with learning the ultrasound representation of anatomy, may overwhelm a novice learner. Our goal was to develop and evaluate a set of ultrasound puzzle phantoms for students to use as they learn isolated, specific transducer movements and sonographic concepts. We intentionally created phantoms that contain objects that are likely familiar to students to reduce the cognitive load associated with simultaneously learning the ultrasound interpretation of anatomy. This preliminary evaluation of our novel, homemade, gelatin ultrasound puzzle phantoms was performed using pretests and posttests obtained by scanning an assessment phantom, and student questionnaires. Two phases of training and testing occurred with feedback from Phase 1 allowing for refinement of the puzzles and techniques for testing. Skills taught and evaluated included probe rotation, depth assessment, sliding, and tilting. Twenty-eight students attended the Phase 1 training session with positive trends in students' abilities to use rotation, sliding, and tilting to answer questions, while only depth showed statistically significant improvements (p = 0.021). Overall students agreed the experience a productive use of time (86%), was beneficial (93%), and would recommend to others (93%). Fifteen (54%) students returned 3 months later. There was no significant decay in skills obtained from the prior training session. In Phase 2, 134 medical students participated, and 76 (57%) completed an online questionnaire. A majority of students agreed they had a better understanding of rotation (83%), depth (80%), sliding (88%) and tilting (55%). Similar to Phase 1, many students (75%) felt the experience was beneficial. This preliminary study gave us insight into student opinions, as well as information to guide future scalability and development of additional ultrasound puzzle phantoms to aid in medical student education of isolated transducer movements and sonographic concepts prior to imaging human anatomy.","Maloney Lauren M, Seidman Peggy A, Zach Kristen M, Tewari Neera K, Tito Matthew F, Page Christopher R",BMC medical education,2020,31996188,PMC6988293,10.1186/s12909-020-1937-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31996188,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988293,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Assessing the Efficacy of an Online Preoperative Evaluation Course for PGY-1 Anesthesiology Residents.,"The impact of an online postgraduate year (PGY-1) education program on anesthesiology resident knowledge base, anxiety, or preparedness has not been described previously. The literature shows resident knowledge of perioperative care is lower than expected. The Johns Hopkins Preoperative Evaluation and Anesthesia Course was designed as an 8 module, 8 month online academic curriculum for the program's PGY-1 class. Each module includes a pretest, topic synopsis, lecture video, moderated case discussion and a posttest. All PGY-1 residents entering the program in July 2012 were eligible to participate. Residents starting in July 2010 served as the control group. A survey was administered to measure self-assessed knowledge of and comfort with components of preoperative anesthesia care and perceived anxiety about starting the clinical anesthesia year. Additional outcome measures included performance on the pretest and postmodule tests and Anesthesia Knowledge Test scores from day 1 of Clinical Anesthesia year 1 (CA-1, PGY-2) orientation. Statistical analysis included independent t tests, the Mann-Whitney test, and sensitivity analyses. Residents in the intervention group showed an improvement of 16.25 to 39.60 percentage points between the pretest and posttest in each of the 8 subjects (P < .0001 in every subject). The intervention group median score was 24 percentile points higher on the Anesthesia Knowledge Test as compared with the control group (P = .0488; lower 95% CI, 9.92). Significant improvement was also seen across measures including comfort advising about medications (P < .0001), understanding of coexisting disease (P < .0001), comfort assessing patient airway (P = .0002), and anxiety about starting PGY-2 year (P = .0116).

Transition to Practice in Anesthesiology: Survey Results of Practicing Anesthesiologists on Their Experience.,"To assess the experiences and attitudes of practicing anesthesiologists on practice/business management training received during residency and transitioning to practice through an online survey. An online survey, consisting of 39 questions developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Young Physicians, was emailed to 2 6551 practicing US anesthesiologists who were ASA members. Questions about individuals' demographic information, transition to practice (TTP) experiences, medical business training, and TTP curricula in residency were included. Results were reported as descriptive statistics. A total of 1199 responses were obtained (response rate 4.5%), and68% reported working in private practice over an average of 17 years. Those practicing ≤ 10 years were more likely to have a TTP curriculum in residency compared to those in practice ≥ 11 years. Common problems reported by many participants regarding TTP included: lack of effective mentorship, inadequate residency curricula/education, and an unfamiliarity with available resources. Although medical business practice education is now required by training programs, there is room for improvement in education. One potential solution is establishing TTP curricula in residency programs, which emphasize the business aspects of medicine and practice management, thus easing trainees from a training to practice environment.","Kuza Catherine M, Harbell Monica W, Malinzak Elizabeth B, Goff Kristina L, Bicket Mark C, Ifeanyi-Pillette Ifey C, Wong Becky J, Khanna Ashish K",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2019,31988980,PMC6972967,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31988980,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972967,TRUE,Transition to Practice (TTP) curricula in residency programs that emphasize business aspects of medicine and practice management,Anesthesiology residents/trainees,"Easing transition from training to practice environment, improving knowledge of business aspects of medicine and practice management",TRUE,"Establishing Transition to Practice (TTP) curricula in residency programs, emphasizing the business aspects of medicine and practice management",Practicing US anesthesiologists who are ASA members,"Easing trainees from a training to practice environment, improvement in education regarding medical business practice"
Women in anaesthesia: a scoping review.,"Despite an increase in the proportion of women anaesthesiologists over time, women remain under-represented in academic and leadership positions, honour awards, and academic promotion. Current literature has identified several reasons for the observed gender disparity in anaesthesiology leadership and faculty positions, including unsupportive work environments, lack of mentorship, personal choices, childcare responsibilities, and active discrimination against women. A scoping review design was selected to examine the nature and extent of available research. Our review provides an overview of the literature that explores gender issues in anaesthesiology, identifies gaps in the literature, and appraises effective strategies to improve gender equity in anaesthesiology. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to July 2019, and included 30 studies for analysis. Most reports used retrospective or survey methodologies. The review shows that women anaesthesiologists face gender biases in the work environment, are under-represented in various positions of leadership or influence, and as authors. Work-life demands may impose a challenge. Motivation and interest in career advancement of women anaesthesiologists have not been well studied. Several strategies have been proposed, ranging from an individual to administrative level, which may help anaesthesiologists achieve equal representation of women in the field.","Bosco Laura, Lorello Gianni R, Flexman Alana M, Hastie Maya J",British journal of anaesthesia,2020,31983412,,10.1016/j.bja.2019.12.021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31983412,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Medical science faces the post-truth era: a plea for the grassroot values of science.,"Science and its public perception are compromised by scientific fraud and predatory journals, and also by the general erosion of the meaning of truth in the so-called post-truth era. These developments have significant influence on scientific medicine and their impact on the public discourse. The purpose of this article is to show how fake science, and also the uncritical dissemination of compromised results in public and social media, threatens scientific medicine. As social media rises to the preferred source of information of ever larger parts of the modern societies, the dissemination of falsified scientific results within the communities is almost unstoppable. With growing numbers of predatory journals and repetitive cases of fake science, the risk of publication of false results increases. Due to the underlying mechanisms of the post-truth era and social media, these compromised results find their way to the public discourse and continue to be disseminated even when they were, beyond all doubt, proven to be a lie. In medical sciences, dissemination of falsified results directly threats health and life of patients. In the post-truth era, publication of false results in predatory journals and by fraudulent authors become even more dangerous for the health and life of patients, as their dissemination via new social media is nearly unstoppable and in the public perception truth is losing its meaning. The scientific community has implemented specific counter-measures to minimize the chances of false results being published. However, it is even more important that every participant in the scientific process assumes the responsibility according to his or her role. An orientation towards the values that have constituted and formed science is helpful in fulfilling this responsibility.",Heinrich Sebastian,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2020,31972566,,10.1097/ACO.0000000000000833,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31972566,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Non-Canonical Microstate Becomes Salient in High Density EEG During Propofol-Induced Altered States of Consciousness.,"Dynamically assessing the level of consciousness is still challenging during anesthesia. With the help of Electroencephalography (EEG), the human brain electric activity can be noninvasively measured at high temporal resolution. Several typical quasi-stable states are introduced to represent the oscillation of the global scalp electric field. These so-called microstates reflect spatiotemporal dynamics of coherent neural activities and capture the switch of brain states within the millisecond range. In this study, the microstates of high-density EEG were extracted and investigated during propofol-induced transition of consciousness. To analyze microstates on the frequency domain, a novel microstate-wise spectral analysis was proposed by the means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert-Huang transform. During the transition of consciousness, a map with a posterior central maximum denoted as microstate F appeared and became salient. The current results indicated that the coverage, occurrence, and power of microstate F significantly increased in moderate sedation. The results also demonstrated that the transition of brain state from rest to sedation was accompanied by significant increase in mean energy of all frequency bands in microstate F. Combined with studies on the possible cortical sources of microstates, the findings reveal that non-canonical microstate F is highly associated with propofol-induced altered states of consciousness. The results may also support the inference that this distinct topography can be derived from canonical microstate C (anterior-posterior orientation). Finally, this study further develops pertinent methodology and extends possible applications of the EEG microstate during propofol-induced anesthesia.","Shi Wen, Li Yamin, Liu Zhian, Li Jing, Wang Qiang, Yan Xiangguo, Wang Gang",International journal of neural systems,2020,31969080,,10.1142/S0129065720500057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969080,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Using electronic health record system triggers to target delivery of a patient-centered intervention to improve venous thromboembolism prevention for hospitalized patients: Is there a differential effect by race?,"Racial disparities are common in healthcare. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of preventable harm, and disparities observed in prevention practices. We examined the impact of a patient-centered VTE education bundle on the non-administration of preventive prophylaxis by race. A post-hoc, subset analysis (stratified by race) of a larger nonrandomized trial. Pre-post comparisons analysis were conducted on 16 inpatient units; study periods were October 2014 through March 2015 (baseline) and April through December 2015 (post-intervention). Patients on 4 intervention units received the patient-centered, nurse educator-led intervention if the electronic health record alerted a non-administered dose of VTE prophylaxis. Patients on 12 control units received no intervention. We compared the conditional odds of non-administered doses of VTE prophylaxis when patient refusal was a reason for non-administration, stratified by race. Of 272 patient interventions, 123 (45.2%) were white, 126 (46.3%) were black, and 23 (8.5%) were other races. A significant reduction was observed in the odds of non-administration of prophylaxis on intervention units compared to control units among patients who were black (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46-0.81, p<0.001), white (OR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.75, p<0.001), and other races (OR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.88, p = 0.015). Our finding suggests that the patient education materials, developed collaboratively with a diverse group of patients, improved patient's understanding and the importance of VTE prevention through prophylaxis. Quality improvement interventions should examine any differential effects by patient characteristics to ensure disparities are addressed and all patients experience the same benefits.","Owodunni Oluwafemi P, Haut Elliott R, Shaffer Dauryne L, Hobson Deborah B, Wang Jiangxia, Yenokyan Gayane, Kraus Peggy S, Aboagye Jonathan K, Florecki Katherine L, Webster Kristen L W, Holzmueller Christine G, Streiff Michael B, Lau Brandyn D",PloS one,2020,31945085,PMC6964816,10.1371/journal.pone.0227339,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945085,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6964816,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Other Side of Medical Student Mistreatment: Teaching Cultural Competency Across the Generational Divide.,"Medical student mistreatment continues to be a significant problem despite increased awareness and longitudinal efforts to address the issue. Through audience discussions of a previously published film depicting learner mistreatment, we identified challenges created by student behaviors that negatively impact the learning environment. In addition, the need to address cultural competency in a multigenerational clinical environment became apparent. We created a film of three vignettes based on perspectives shared in focus groups by faculty, residents, nurses, and staff who work with medical students. We used this film to develop student and faculty curricula elucidating generational differences in behaviors and expectations while also exploring the learner's role in creating a more positive learning environment. Our film was presented to medical education professionals at faculty development workshops and meetings, clerkship students at orientation sessions, residents as part of residents-as-teachers curricula, and faculty at departmental grand rounds. Evaluation data from 176 students and 42 faculty showed that a majority of our participants believed the film accurately reflected challenges they faced in the learning environment and felt better equipped to address them. Film is an effective way to stimulate discussion about complex interactions in the clinical learning environment. Divergent perspectives on behaviors depicted in the film served as a stimulus to create targeted curricula for faculty and student education. Stimulating dialogue through film may enhance understanding and empathy among disparate groups, which is likely to be a necessary step for lasting change.","Feldman Nathalie L, Lewis Judith L, Patel Charmaine K, Ackerman Sean F, Howe Alison K, Harari David Y, Evans Katherine M, Adams David C",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2019,31921993,PMC6946582,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10847,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31921993,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946582,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Esketamine in Chinese Patients Undergoing Painless Gastroscopy in Comparison with Ketamine: A Randomized, Open-Label Clinical Study.","To assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of pure S-ketamine (esketamine) in Chinese patients undergoing painless gastroscopy and evaluate the potential advantage of esketamine in clinical treatment compared with racemate ketamine hydrochloride injection. A randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, Phase I study was performed with 32 patients undergoing painless gastroscopy. Patients received a single dose of esketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg, esketamine:R-ketamine=1:1), injected in 10 s. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. The concentrations of esketamine, R-ketamine, S-norketamine, and R-norketamine were measured with a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. After administering a single dose of esketamine and racemate ketamine, the pharmacokinetics parameters of esketamine and S-norketamine are both similar in treatment groups. The clearance of esketamine in two groups was 18.1±3.2 and 18.4±3.4 mL/min•kg, respectively. However, in the ketamine group, esketamine has a larger clearance than R-ketamine (18.4±3.4 mL/min·kg vs 15.8±3.1 mL/min·kg, <i>P</i><0.001). Further analysis showed that gender did not affect the pharmacokinetics of esketamine and racemate ketamine. Regarding the safety of esketamine and racemate ketamine, no serious adverse events were observed during treatment, and the incidences of adverse events were 75.0% (esketamine) and 87.5% (racemate ketamine). The main adverse reactions were dizziness, agitation, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. However, compared with racemic ketamine, esketamine offers a shorter recovery time (9 mins vs. 13 mins, P<0.05) and orientation recovery time (11.5 mins vs. 17 mins, P<0.05) after short anesthesia. Esketamine administration as a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg was generally safe and tolerated in patients undergoing painless gastroscopy. In terms of anesthesia, a relatively small dose of esketamine can be used instead of racemate ketamine for routine treatment without consideration of gender differences.","Wang Jing, Huang Jie, Yang Shuang, Cui Chang, Ye Ling, Wang Sai-Ying, Yang Guo-Ping, Pei Qi","Drug design, development and therapy",2019,31827320,PMC6902860,10.2147/DDDT.S224553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31827320,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902860,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Comparison of Three Point-of-Care Ultrasound Views and MRI Measurements for Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter: A Prospective Validity Study.,"Point-of-care ultrasound of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) to diagnose increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is of great interest in various clinical scenarios. Yet, the lack of examination standardization has made clinical utility difficult. We compare three ultrasound ocular plane views (inferior, sagittal, and transverse), which are currently used in the literature to evaluate their consistency. Comparisons for each view to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements were also made. Fifty-one patients with recent MRI of the brain, but without clinical or radiological signs of elevated ICP, were selected to undergo ocular sonography via three ultrasound planes (inferior, sagittal, and transverse). Optic nerve sheath was measured in each ultrasound view as well with MRI. Image quality scores were assigned for the ultrasound views in different orientations. The three ocular plane views were analyzed for correlation. In addition, correlation of the three ocular ultrasound views with MRI was also performed. Correlation analysis showed a wide variability in the correlation between different ultrasound views with magnitude range of 0.1 to 0.8 and directions being both positive and negative. There was a difference in image quality scores between the ultrasound views. The inferior and transverse orientations were superior to the sagittal orientation in achieving high image quality. Comparison to MRI measurements did not demonstrate a significant correlation. Our findings suggest that absolute measurements should not be compared across different ultrasound orientations given the wide variability in the correlation between the ultrasound views used to assess the optic nerve sheath. The inferior and transverse ultrasound views are the most likely to yield high-quality images, although the specific view, for the best image, in an individual patient can vary.

A total of 48 patients (mean age 64 years) underwent LRP in our institution between August 2014 and July 2018. Two surgeons completed a fellowship training program for LRP before. Mentored operations started after the first 10 cases. The patients were divided in two groups of 30 (group I) and 18 (group II) patients. Demographic, preoperative, peroperative, and postoperative data were collected prospectively. Anesthesiology and nurses' team performances, as well as problems and their management, were reviewed. The demographic data for both groups (group I vs. group II) were similar. Estimated blood loss (695.5±139.23 vs. 398±339.39 mL) and intraoperative complication rates (36.66% vs. 5.55%) were significantly (p<0.05) higher in group I. Conversion to open surgery occurred in 7 (20%) patients in group I and in 1 (5.55%) patient in group II. Continence rates at 12 (83%) months were similar in both groups. Positive surgical margins were 8.33% for pT2 and 27.1% for pT3 stages. A validated fellowship program before starting LRP and performing the first cases under mentorship are helpful. The complication and conversion rates decrease after 30 cases in addition to the improved experience also with improved cooperation with the anesthesiologist and scrub nurse.","Akdere Hakan, Aktoz Tevfik, Arıkan Mehmet Gürkan, Atakan İrfan Hüseyin, Veneziano Domenico, Gözen Ali Serdar",Turkish journal of urology,2020,31657697,PMC6944418,10.5152/tud.2019.19008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31657697,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944418,FALSE,,,,TRUE,A validated fellowship program before starting laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and performing the first cases under mentorship,"Surgeons, anesthesiologists, and scrub nurses involved in LRP","Decreased complication and conversion rates after 30 cases, improved experience, and improved cooperation with the anesthesiologist and scrub nurse"
"Learning Gaps and Family Experience, Nurse-Facilitated Home Parenteral Nutrition Simulation-Based Discharge Training: Proof-of-Concept Study.","Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is a life-sustaining therapy for children and adults suffering with severe digestive diseases, yet complications are commonplace, and predischarge trainings are variable. High-fidelity simulation training provides participants with an immersive experience using realistic equipment, supplies, and scenarios. Simulation training is rapidly becoming a potential gold standard for healthcare but is currently underutilized for families and caregivers. We prospectively collected data on pediatric patients managed at a single HPN program from September 1, 2016, to September 30, 2018. Participants in a pilot simulation-based training program (orientation, high-fidelity mannequin, realistic homelike space, standardized clinical scenarios, and structured debriefing) were compared with historical controls. We excluded patients with short-term HPN use and strictly palliative goals of care. Nineteen (90%) families participated in the pilot initiative with a median (interquartile range) age of 0.9 (3.7) years and diagnosis of short-bowel syndrome in 14 (74%). During teaching scenarios, learning gaps were identified for aseptic needleless changes (53%), HPN equipment setup (84%) with specific difficulty adding multivitamin (32%), and dressing changes (63%). Thirty-day readmission rates in simulation-based training group vs historical cases were 42% vs 63% (P = not significant). There was no difference in length of stay between groups. All (100%) simulation-based training group participants would recommend this learning experience to others. HPN discharge training is a novel use for high-fidelity simulation to address family/caregiver satisfaction and to identify learning gaps. Further studies are needed to refine predischarge training materials and examine the impact on postdischarge outcomes.","Raphael Bram P, Takvorian-Bené Melissa, Gallotto Mary, Tascione Christina, McClelland Jennifer, Rosa Carolyn, Dinan Jessica, O'Connell Brianna, Weinstock Peter",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2021,31589007,,10.1002/ncp.10421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31589007,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Hemodynamics of neonatal double lumen cannula malposition.,"Malposition of dual lumen cannula is a frequent and challenging complication in neonates and plays a significant role in shaping the in vitro device hemodynamics. This study aims to analyze the effect of the dual lumen cannula malposition on right-atrial hemodynamics in neonatal patients using an experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics model. A computer model was developed for clinically approved dual lumen cannula (13Fr Origen Biomedical, Austin, Texas, USA) oriented inside the atrium of a 3-kg neonate with normal venous return. Atrial hemodynamics and dual lumen cannula malposition were systematically simulated for two rotations (antero-atrial and atrio-septal) and four translations (two intravascular movements along inferior vena cava and two dislodged configurations in the atrium). A multi-domain compartmentalized mesh was prepared to allow the site-specific evaluation of important hemodynamic parameters. Transport of each blood stream, blood damage levels, and recirculation times are quantified and compared to dual lumen cannula in proper position. High recirculation levels (39 ± 4%) in malpositioned cases resulted in poor oxygen saturation where maximum recirculation of up to 42% was observed. Apparently, Origen dual lumen cannula showed poor inferior vena cava blood-capturing efficiency (48 ± 8%) but high superior vena cava blood-capturing efficiency (86 ± 10%). Dual lumen cannula malposition resulted in corresponding changes in residence time (1.7 ± 0.5 seconds through the tricuspid). No significant differences in blood damage were observed among the simulated cases compared to normal orientation. Compared to the correct dual lumen cannula position, both rotational and translational displacements of the dual lumen cannula resulted in significant hemodynamic differences. Rotational or translational movement of dual lumen cannula is the determining factor for atrial hemodynamics, venous capturing efficiency, blood residence time, and oxygenated blood delivery. Results obtained through computational fluid dynamics methodology can provide valuable foresight in assessing the performance of the dual lumen cannula in patient-specific configurations.","Jamil Muhammad, Rezaeimoghaddam Mohammad, Cakmak Bilgesu, Yildiz Yahya, Rasooli Reza, Pekkan Kerem, Salihoglu Ece",Perfusion,2020,31580212,,10.1177/0267659119874697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31580212,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
[INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE INTERNSHIP YEAR].,"To describe three interventions that have improved the quality of the internship. All medical school graduates are required to take a one year internship, rotating through various hospital departments. By various objective and subjective measures, the quality, benefit and efficacy of the internship varies significantly between departments and hospitals and also depends on where the interns studied. The interventions were: First, all graduates of foreign medical schools (FMG) were required to interview and present a patient, demonstrating practical knowledge of spoken and written Hebrew and basic medical terminology prior to the start of the internship. Second, on the first day of their internship in internal medicine the new interns participate in an orientation day, addressing multiple clinical, administrative and other components. Third, upon the completion of their rotation in internal medicine, the interns participate in an interactive session to help them prepare for their future career. First, during the first 3 years after introducing the Hebrew test, 101 FMGs took the test, 89 (88%) passed the first time, the remainder passed the 2nd or 3rd test after another 1-3 months of studying Hebrew. Of 31 women, 30 (97%) passed the first time, compared to 59/70 (84%) of the men (p=0.065); 27/28 (96%) of Jewish interns passed the first time compared to 62/73 (85%) non-Jewish interns (p=0.99). Physicians report on the significantly increased ability of FMGs to participate in all activities from the onset of their internship. Second, upon completion of the orientation, 137 interns provided feedback of its 12 components; satisfaction was marked on a Likert scale (ranging from 1 [low] to 5 [high]) and ranged from 4.2±0.1 to 4.7±0.6; high/very high satisfaction with the various components ranged from 79% to 96%. Third, feedback was provided by 96 interns after participating in the interactive session helping to prepare for the future; satisfaction with the 5 components of the session ranged from 3.8±0.8 (on the acquired insight into the possibilities, scope and limitations regarding their future career) to 4.5±0.7 (regarding the relevance of such sessions). Sub-analysis revealed several statistically significant differences between male and female interns (male interns indicated these sessions to be more important to them than females, p<0.01), and FMG (as compared to graduates from Israeli medical schools) indicated that they had acquired relevant information more often (p<0.001).

"Arthur Guedel and the Ascendance of Anesthesia: A Teacher, Tinkerer, and Transformer.","At the beginning of the twentieth century, anesthesia was an emerging field without permanent departments, exclusive practitioners, or academic residency programs. Instead, surgeons and nurses administered anesthetic gases in an ad-hoc fashion, exposing patients to the perilous risks of general anesthesia. Dr. Arthur Guedel was a general practitioner from rural Indiana who unexpectedly became an integral part of anesthesia's evolution into a safety conscience and formally recognized expertise. Beginning during his military service in World War I, he refined the stages of ether anesthesia and produced the definitive textbook on inhalational anesthetics. During the prolific career that followed, Guedel also introduced ground-breaking devices for patient-controlled analgesia, cuffed endotracheal intubation, and oral airway patency. His inclusive mentorship, collaborative research, and innovative instruments exemplify his role as a multitalented tinkerer, teacher, and transformative leader. This essay examines Guedel's pioneering contributions and the scope of his influence, all of which revolutionized anesthesia and expanded surgeons' operative capability. Through the lens of Guedel's personal and professional life, this essay further illustrates how the diverse, interdisciplinary, and cutting edge characteristics of the practice itself contributed to anesthesia's increased importance in modern medicine.",Drew Benjamin A,Journal of anesthesia history,2019,31570202,,10.1016/j.janh.2018.08.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570202,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Ultrasound-guided maxillary nerve block: an anatomical study using the suprazygomatic approach.,"Although a maxillary nerve (MN) block reportedly provides satisfactory analgesia for midface surgery and chronic maxillofacial pain syndromes, a safe and reliable MN block technique has not been reported. The goal of this anatomical study was to quantify the various angles and depth of the block needle, as well as to evaluate the impact of volume on the extent of injectate spread that might influence anesthetic coverage and block-related complications. Following an ultrasound-guided suprazygomatic MN block with dye injection, a dissection was performed in the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) of four lightly embalmed cadaveric specimens. Half of the specimens were injected with 5 mL of dye, and the other half with 1 mL of dye. The needle depth was measured from the ultrasound images and using rubber markers. Following injection, dissection was performed to map the area of dye spread. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] distance from the skin to the PPF was 37 [36-43] mm and 47 [40-50] mm by ultrasound and rubber marker methods, respectively. The median [IQR] needle orientation was 14 [11-32] degrees inferiorly and 15 [10-17] degrees posteriorly. The PPF was consistently dyed in the 5 mL group, but sporadically dyed in the 1 mL group. In the 5 mL group, spread outside of the PPF was seen. We showed that 5 mL of injectate far exceeds the capacity of the PPF, leading to drug spread outside of the PPF. Moreover, we found that 1 mL of injectate largely covered the nerve, suggesting a more efficacious and safer block procedure. This finding will need confirmation in future clinical studies.","Echaniz Gaston, Chan Vincent, Maynes Jason T, Jozaghi Yelda, Agur Anne",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2020,31549339,,10.1007/s12630-019-01481-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31549339,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Under Pressure to Perform: Impact of Academic Goal Orientation, School Motivational Climate, and School Engagement on Pain and Somatic Symptoms in Adolescents.","Various academic factors are known to influence pain and somatic symptoms in adolescents, but the roles of academic goal orientation, school motivational climate, and school engagement are unknown. This study examined how these understudied academic factors are associated with adolescent pain and somatic symptoms and whether sex moderates the relations. High school students (n=90) from a high-achieving community completed questionnaires assessing academic variables, various pain characteristics, and somatic symptoms. The majority of adolescents (67%) experienced pain and somatic symptoms in the past month, with 56% reporting multisite pain and 58% reporting at least 1 severe somatic symptom. Headache and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported ""most bothersome"" pains, and pain was rated, on average, as moderately severe, typically occurring several times per month, and was primarily chronic in nature (duration, ≥3 mo). Higher levels of ego goal orientation and perceived performance motivational climate were associated with more somatic symptoms, and ego goal orientation was also associated with more intense and frequent pain. Alternatively, greater school engagement was associated with fewer somatic symptoms. Task goal orientation and mastery motivational climate were unassociated with all pain and somatic symptom outcomes. This study demonstrates that adolescents from a high-achieving community report more somatic symptoms and pain when they are less engaged in school and when their academic focus is on grades and outperforming peers. Results suggest that de-emphasizing competition and performance outcomes may support physical well-being in adolescents.","Randall Edin T, Shapiro Jenna B, Smith Kelly R, Jervis Kelsey N, Logan Deirdre E",The Clinical journal of pain,2019,31513055,,10.1097/AJP.0000000000000765,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513055,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Changes of collective orientation through a medical student's anaesthesia simulation course - simulation-based training study with non-technical skills debriefing versus medical debriefing.,"Non-technical skills (NTS) are known to have a positive impact on quality of medical care. The team performance enhancing behaviour, as an example for NTS, is termed ""Collective Orientation"" (CO). In this study, we investigated the effect of a simulator-based anaesthesia training upon student's CO in relation to medical and TeamGAINS (guided team self-correction, advocacy-inquiry and systemic-constructivist techniques) debriefing. We hypothesized (a) the scale collective orientation, as demonstrated in other team setting, is applicable to fourth year German medical students, (b) collective orientation increases by a four-hour anaesthesia simulation course, (c) the change in collective orientation can be influenced by type of debriefing. All classes of an anaesthesia module (4th year medical students) were randomized into two groups. Students took part in a four-hour simulation course with team scenarios, supported by a simulated nurse. In group one the trainer focused on a debriefing on medical problems and in group two, a debriefing according to the specifications of the TeamGAINS concept was conducted. The primary outcome was the mean difference between the collective orientation measured (via questionnaires) immediately before (T1) and after (T2) training. Cronbach's alpha for all scales and measurement points was higher than 0.72. The scale ""affiliation"" decreases in the group medical debriefing MD = 0.1 (p = 0.008; r = 0.31) and was unchanged in the group TeamGAINS. ""Dominance"" increases in both groups. The values were MD = 0.19 (p = 0.003; r = 0.25) for medical debriefing and MD = 0.22 (p = 0.01; r = 0.40) for TeamGAINS debriefing. The collective orientation questionnaire can be applied to fourth year medical students. Simulation courses influence the attitude towards teamwork. The influence is negatively to the subscale ""affiliation"" by a ""medical debriefing"" and independently regardless of the nature of the debriefing for the subscale ""dominance"". We recommend a debriefing for medical students using the TeamGAINS approach to clarify the connection between the individual performance and non-technical skills. Anaesthesia simulation courses have the potential being a part of a longitudinal education curriculum for teaching non-technical skills.","Eismann Hendrik, Palmaers Thomas, Tsvetanov Svetlozar, Hagemann Vera, Flentje Markus",BMC medical education,2019,31488119,PMC6727403,10.1186/s12909-019-1765-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488119,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6727403,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Role of Ultrasound in the Detection of Rotator-Cuff Syndrome: An Observational Study.,"BACKGROUND Physical tests are usually preferred to assess rotator-cuff syndrome but are insufficient to predict the morphology and size of the rotator-cuff. The objective of the study was to rate the ultrasound findings for patients with sudden shoulder pain and to determine potential predictors of the same. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 112 patients with sudden shoulder pain with rotator-cuff syndrome, suspected by orthopedic doctors, were subjected to ultrasonography. Real-time ultrasonography was done for the acromioclavicular joint, biceps, infraspinatus, posterior labrum, subscapularis, supraspinatus, teres minor tendon, and the sub-acromial-subdeltoid bursa. Each tendon was assessed via scanning planes in orientation as per longer and shorter axis, and from their myotendinous junction shoulder to bony insertions. Linear and logistic regression analysis were performed to predict the associations of medical history with rotator-cuff injury. RESULTS Ultrasonography identified that 82% of the enrolled patients had at least one particular cause of the rotator-cuff disorder. Among the rotator-cuff disorders, calcific tendonitis (54%) was observed more frequently followed by tendinopathy (32%), subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis (22%), and partial thickness tear (21%). Also, 46 patients (41%) had multiple findings. Older age (older than 40 years) was a strong predicting factor of rotator-cuff disorder (r²=0.36, P=0.0004).

Surgical Cross-Training With Surgery Naive Learners: Implications for Resident Training.,"While current literature has explored the transferability of laparoscopic surgical skills to robotic surgery, this study looks to investigate the transferability of surgical skills between robotic surgical simulation and simulated traditional laparoscopy. Participants completed a survey regarding prior surgery exposure and other confounding factors including previous video game experience and self-assessed hand-eye coordination. Following orientation to the laparoscopic simulator (LS) and robotic surgical simulator (RoSS), participants were timed performing the Balloon Grasp and Ball Drop tasks on the RoSS and the Peg Transfer and Ball Drop tasks on the LS. Participants were then randomized to either the laparoscopic or RoSS arm and timed performing the Ball Drop task 10 times and then reassessed performing the Ball Drop using the unpracticed modality. Clinical Simulation Laboratory at the University of Vermont PARTICIPANTS: A total of 31 medical students with limited experience in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographics or prior surgical and videogame experience between the participants in the laparoscopic and robotic arms of the study (X<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, p = 0.75). Timed initial assessment of the RoSS Balloon Grasp (p = 0.84) and Ball Drop (p = 0.79) tasks and the LS Peg Transfer (p = 0.14) and Ball Drop (p = 0.44) tasks were not statistically different between the 2 arms. The simulator modality which was practiced yielded the greatest improvement. The degree of improvement on the unpracticed modality was not statistically different between the groups (p = 0.57), and it was not significantly better than 2 rounds of sequential practice on the practiced modality (LS, p = 0.98 and RoSS, p = 0.55). With practice, both groups increased surgical skill on the unpracticed modality. However, this degree of improvement was equal, suggesting there is no transferability of skills between laparoscopy and robotics.","Ashley Charles W, Donaldson Katelyn, Evans Katherine M, Nielsen Brian, Everett Elise N",Journal of surgical education,2019,31303542,,10.1016/j.jsurg.2019.06.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31303542,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Survey of Women Physicians' Experience with Elected Leadership Positions.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Women physicians do not advance in academic promotion or leadership at the same rate as their male counterparts. One factor contributing to academic promotion and advancement is the experience of serving in elected leadership positions. Although >400 women are running for political office in 2018, fewer than a handful are physicians and there has never been a woman physician elected to the Congress. Yet, little is known about women physicians who run for elected positions within their institutions, medical/professional societies, or government. This study sought to examine how women physicians experience elections using a cross-sectional survey of women physicians to gain insight into patterns of reported experiences and perceived barriers to elected leadership positions. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey study of 1221 women physicians. <b>Results:</b> 43.8% (N=535) of women physicians ran for an elected office from high school through medical school graduation, in contrast to only 16.7% (N=204) after graduating from medical school. Only 8.5% of women physicians surveyed reported a boss or supervisor encouraged them to run for an elected position. <b>Conclusion:</b> Women physicians are less likely to run for elected positions and for those with previous election experience, the most common barriers cited were lack of institutional time and support, experience, and mentorship.","Shillcutt Sasha K, Parangi Sareh, Diekman Sarah, Ghalib Reem, Schoenthaler Robin, Girgis Linda M, Parekh Ranna, Bhargava Hansa, Silver Julie K",Health equity,2019,31289775,PMC6608691,10.1089/heq.2018.0101,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31289775,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6608691,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Interprofessional Attitudes and Interdisciplinary Practices for Older Adults With Back Pain Among Doctors of Chiropractic: A Descriptive Survey.,"The purpose of this study is to report on attitudes of doctors of chiropractic (DCs) toward integrative medicine and their self-reported interdisciplinary practices for older adults with back pain. This descriptive survey was conducted with licensed DCs in a Midwestern community in the United States. Respondents completed a 53-item postal survey of demographics, practice characteristics, referral and co-management patterns, attitudes toward interdisciplinary practice, and the Integrative Medicine-30 Questionnaire (IM-30). Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Fifty-seven DCs completed the survey (29% response). Geriatric-focused chiropractic practices were uncommon (<15%), although 56% reported that 25% to 49% of the patients treated each week were older adults. Respondents had a moderate orientation toward collaboration with other health care providers (IM-30 mean [standard deviation] 61.3 [11.5]). The IM-30 subscales placed DCs high on measures of integrative medicine safety; moderate on patient-centeredness, openness to working with other providers, and referral readiness; and low on learning from alternative paradigms. Doctors of chiropractic most referred older patients to neurologists, family physicians, massage therapists, orthopedists, and other chiropractors. Doctors of chiropractic reported the highest levels of co-management with family physicians, physical therapists, and massage therapists. Most DCs (92%) were confident in their own ability to manage back pain in older adults, with modest confidence expressed for treatments from professionals using manual therapies. Most (77%) responded that older patients would experience the most improvement if DCs collaborated with another chiropractor, rather than with medical professionals. Doctors of chiropractic in one geographic community are moderately oriented toward interprofessional practice with other health care providers for older adults with back pain. Follow-up studies in representative national and international samples are recommended.","Salsbury Stacie A, Vining Robert D, Hondras Maria A, Wallace Robert B, Lyons Kevin J, Killinger Lisa Z, Goertz Christine M",Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,2019,31257002,,10.1016/j.jmpt.2018.11.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31257002,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Premedication effect of melatonin on propofol induction dose for anesthesia, anxiety, orientation and sedation after abdominal surgery: a double-blinded randomized trial.","The present study addressed the effect of melatonin premedication on propofol induction dose for anesthesia in abdominal surgery. This is a double-blinded clinical trial in which abdominal surgery patients admitted to the Valiasr Hospital, Iran (n = 88) were enrolled and individually randomized into two groups: melatonin and placebo groups sublingually administered 3 mg of melatonin and placebo, respectively, 50 minutes before surgery. Their anxiety, orientation, and sedation were recorded before melatonin administration, anesthesia induction, and recovery, while we also recorded the propofol induction dose required for general anesthesia. Anxiety was seen less in the melatonin group than the placebo group (P < 0.05), whereas orientation was significantly different before anesthesia induction (P = 0.044) and sedation was the same before the induction (P = 0.044) and recovery (P = 0.049) in both groups, with a better efficiency in the melatonin group in which a lower dose of propofol was used (P = 0.002). The sedation, anxiety, and propofol dose used were lower in the melatonin group than the placebo group. The recommended dosage was 3 mg of melatonin once to achieve an anesthetic depth index or a bispectral index of 40. The study was approved by Ethical Committee of Arak University of Medical Sciences with IR.ARAKMU.REC.1395.432 code in July 2016, and the trial was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with IRCT20141209020258N98 in September 2016.","Norouzi Afsaneh, Fateh Shahin, Modir Hesameddin, Kamali Alireza, Akrami Leila",Medical gas research,2019,31249253,PMC6607868,10.4103/2045-9912.260646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31249253,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6607868,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Real-time magnetic resonance imaging - guided coronary intervention in a porcine model.,"X-ray fluoroscopy is the gold standard for coronary diagnostics and intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging is a radiation-free alternative to x-ray with excellent soft tissue contrast in arbitrary slice orientation. Here, we assessed real-time MRI-guided coronary interventions from femoral access using newly designed MRI technologies. Six Goettingen minipigs were used to investigate coronary intervention using real-time MRI. Catheters were custom-designed and equipped with an active receive tip-coil to improve visibility and navigation capabilities. Using modified standard clinical 5 F catheters, intubation of the left coronary ostium was successful in all animals. For the purpose of MR-guided coronary interventions, a custom-designed 8 F catheter was used. In spite of the large catheter size, and therefore limited steerability, intubation of the left coronary ostium was successful in 3 of 6 animals within seconds. Thereafter, real-time guided implantation of a non-metallic vascular scaffold into coronary arteries was possible. This study demonstrates that real-time MRI-guided coronary catheterization and intervention via femoral access is possible without the use of any contrast agents or radiation, including placement of non-metallic vascular scaffolds into coronary arteries. Further development, especially in catheter and guidewire technology, will be required to drive forward routine MR-guided coronary interventions as an alternative to x-ray fluoroscopy.","Heidt Timo, Reiss Simon, Krafft Axel J, Özen Ali Caglar, Lottner Thomas, Hehrlein Christoph, Galmbacher Roland, Kayser Gian, Hilgendorf Ingo, Stachon Peter, Wolf Dennis, Zirlik Andreas, Düring Klaus, Zehender Manfred, Meckel Stephan, von Elverfeldt Dominik, Bode Christoph, Bock Michael, von Zur Mühlen Constantin",Scientific reports,2019,31209241,PMC6572773,10.1038/s41598-019-45154-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31209241,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6572773,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Preparation of DNA-functionalized surfaces for simultaneous homeotropic orientation of liquid crystals and optical recognition of analytes: application to the determination of progesterone.,"The work describes a simplified method for the preparation of liquid crystal (LC) bioassay using DNA-based capture molecules and having lower detection limits. The capture DNA probes of the stem-loop structure were immobilized on the surface of a glass slide. A homeotropic orientation of LC molecules can be obtained with the proper surface coverage of capture DNA probes. In the presence of analytes (specifically shown here for the progesterone as a model analyte), the molecular binding between capture DNA probes and progesterone opens the loop of the capture DNA probes. The opened sequence is then amenable to hybridization with a reporter DNA probe that is immobilized on gold nanoparticles. This changes the surface microstructure, disrupts the orientation of LC molecules, and results in an enhanced optical response, expressed as the average grey value of the images. This new kind of surface treatment for simultaneous recognition of target molecules and homeotropic anchoring of LCs reduces the number of preparation steps and makes the process of LC bioassay easier.

Comparison between the effect of epidural anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia and general anesthesia combined with intravenous analgesia on prognosis of ovarian cancer patients.,"Application value of epidural anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia and general anesthesia combined with intravenous analgesia in ovarian cancer surgery was explored. In total 298 ASA I-III grade patients with ovarian cancer, undergoing extensive total hysterectomy and pelvic lymphotomy, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: the epidural anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia group (group A, 158 cases), and the general anesthesia combined with intravenous analgesia group (group B, 140 cases). The first exhaust time, incidence of adverse reactions, Aldrete score, and recovery were observed, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores during resting, exercise and cough at 24 h after surgery were recorded. Fasting venous blood (2 ml) was drawn at the same time before anesthesia and at 24 h after anesthesia in both groups to determinate cortisol (COR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The first exhaust time and incidence of adverse reactions in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P<0.05). The Aldrete score and extubation time (ET) in group A were significantly higher than that in group B. Eye opening time (EOT), recovery orientation time (ROT) and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) time in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P<0.05). The VAS scores in group A during resting, exercise and cough were lower than those in group B (P<0.05). Compared with before anesthesia, the levels of COR and CRP increased significantly in both groups at 24 h after anesthesia (P<0.05), while the level of COR and CRP in group A was significantly lower than that in group B, at 24 h after surgery (P<0.05). Epidural anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia has better analgesic effect, higher safety, lower incidence of adverse reactions, and is beneficial to the recovery of patients with ovarian cancer after radical operation when compared with general anesthesia combined with intravenous analgesia.","Zhong Shuigen, Zhong Xiaoxue, Zhong Xiaomei, Liu Yanlong",Oncology letters,2019,31186789,PMC6507469,10.3892/ol.2019.10216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31186789,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6507469,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Multiple neurosteroid and cholesterol binding sites in voltage-dependent anion channel-1 determined by photo-affinity labeling.,"Voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) is a mitochondrial porin that is implicated in cellular metabolism and apoptosis, and modulated by numerous small molecules including lipids. VDAC1 binds sterols, including cholesterol and neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone. Biochemical and computational studies suggest that VDAC1 binds multiple cholesterol molecules, but photolabeling studies have identified only a single cholesterol and neurosteroid binding site at E73. To identify all the binding sites of neurosteroids in VDAC1, we apply photo-affinity labeling using two sterol-based photolabeling reagents with complementary photochemistry: 5α-6-AziP which contains an aliphatic diazirine, and KK200 which contains a trifluoromethyl-phenyldiazirine (TPD) group. 5α-6-AziP and KK200 photolabel multiple residues within an E73 pocket confirming the presence of this site and mapping sterol orientation within this pocket. In addition, KK200 photolabels four other sites consistent with the finding that VDAC1 co-purifies with five cholesterol molecules. Both allopregnanolone and cholesterol competitively prevent photolabeling at E73 and three other sites indicating that these are common sterol binding sites shared by both neurosteroids and cholesterol. Binding at the functionally important residue E73 suggests a possible role for sterols in regulating VDAC1 signaling and interaction with partner proteins.","Cheng Wayland W L, Budelier Melissa M, Sugasawa Yusuke, Bergdoll Lucie, Queralt-Martín María, Rosencrans William, Rostovtseva Tatiana K, Chen Zi-Wei, Abramson Jeff, Krishnan Kathiresan, Covey Douglas F, Whitelegge Julian P, Evers Alex S",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

"Correlation between early clinical exposure environment, attitudes toward basic medicine, and medical students' basic science learning performance.","Early clinical exposure (ECE) is viewed as a way to provide contexts of basic science and highlight its relevance to medical practice. However, very few studies have specifically looked into how the ECE experience contributes to students' academic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether ECE experiences (external cause) or students' learning attitudes (internal cause) more closely correlated with medical students' academic performance. Subjects who participated in the study comprised 109 s-year students at Taipei Medical University. Fifty of the 109 study participants were enrolled in an elective ECE program. The dependent variable in this study was the test score of a systems-based basic sciences (SBBS) course. Independent variables of the study included students' attitudes and test anxiety towards the SBBS course, engagement/length of time spent in ECE, and the ECE learning environment. Data of students' engagement in ECE, levels of their motivational beliefs and test anxiety, differences in the ECE learning environment, and the SBBS final test scores of these 109 respondents were collected for hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) analyses. Results of the HMR analyses revealed that students' test anxiety towards basic science and also the learning environment of the ECE had significant positive predictive power on their SBBS test scores. This study discovers that medical students' academic performance in basic science correlates not only with their anxiety to testing, but even more so with the clinical environment they are exposed to. Hence we suggest including further investigations about different learning environments on ECE experiences in future studies.","Tang Kung-Pei, Chen Chien-Yu, Wu Ming-Shun, Chen Tzu-Tao, Wu Bei-Wen, Tsai Po-Fang",BMC medical education,2019,31159798,PMC6547489,10.1186/s12909-019-1612-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159798,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547489,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The molecular determinants of neurosteroid binding in the GABA(A) receptor.,"Neurosteroids positively modulate GABA-A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) channel activity by binding to a transmembrane domain intersubunit site. Understanding the interactions in this site that determine neurosteroid binding and its effect is essential for the design of neurosteroid-based therapeutics. Using photo-affinity labeling and an ELIC-α1GABA<sub>A</sub>R chimera, we investigated the impact of mutations (Q242L, Q242W and W246L) within the intersubunit site on neurosteroid binding. These mutations, which abolish the thermal stabilizing effect of allopregnanolone on the chimera, reduce neither photolabeling within the intersubunit site nor competitive prevention of labeling by allopregnanolone. Instead, these mutations change the orientation of neurosteroid photolabeling. Molecular docking of allopregnanolone in WT and Q242W receptors confirms that the mutation favors re-orientation of allopregnanolone within the binding pocket. Collectively, the data indicate that mutations at Gln242 or Trp246 that eliminate neurosteroid effects do not eliminate neurosteroid binding within the intersubunit site, but significantly alter the preferred orientation of the neurosteroid within the site. The interactions formed by Gln242 and Trp246 within this pocket play a vital role in determining the orientation of the neurosteroid that may be necessary for its functional effect.","Sugasawa Yusuke, Bracamontes John R, Krishnan Kathiresan, Covey Douglas F, Reichert David E, Akk Gustav, Chen Qiang, Tang Pei, Evers Alex S, Cheng Wayland W L",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019,31150831,PMC6708749,10.1016/j.jsbmb.2019.105383,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31150831,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708749,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Comparative Analysis of Phase Lag Entropy and Bispectral Index as Anesthetic Depth Indicators in Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery with Nerve Integrity Monitoring.,"Most depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitors rely on the temporal characteristics of a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and cannot provide spatial or connectivity information. Phase lag entropy (PLE) reflects DOA by calculating diverse connectivity from temporal patterns of phase relationships. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PLE and bispectral index (BIS) monitors for assessing DOA during anesthesia induction, nerve integrity monitoring (NIM), and anesthesia emergence. Thirty-five patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery with recurrent laryngeal nerve NIM received propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusion. After applying PLE and BIS monitors, propofol infusion was initiated at a calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of 2 μg/mL and then increased in 1-μg/mL Ce increments. After propofol Ce reached 5 μ/mL, a remifentanil infusion was begun, and anesthesia induction was considered complete. During NIM, PLE and BIS values were compared at a specific time points from platysma muscle exposure to subcutaneous tissue closure. PLE and BIS values were recorded continuously from preanesthetic state to full recovery of orientation; bias and limits of agreement between monitors were calculated. PLE and BIS values decreased progressively with increasing propofol Ce during anesthetic induction and increased by stages during emergence. The prediction probabilities of PLE and BIS for detecting propofol Ce changes were 0.750 and 0.756, respectively, during induction and 0.749 and 0.746, respectively, during emergence. No aberrant PLE or BIS values occurred during NIM. Correlation coefficients for BIS and PLE were 0.98 and 0.92 during induction and emergence, respectively. PLE values were significantly higher than BIS values at full recovery of orientation. Estimated bias between monitors was -4.16 ± 8.7, and 95% limits of agreement were -21.21 to 12.89. PLE is a reasonable alternative to BIS for evaluating consciousness and DOA during general anesthesia and during NIM.

Early Prosthetic Valve Malfunction Leading to Cardiogenic Shock and Emergency Redo Mitral Valve Replacement.,"Early onset prosthetic valve stenosis is an uncommon complication after valve replacement surgery and is often caused by thrombus formation. Frequently it can be diagnosed by echocardiography and managed with optimizing anticoagulation and/or thrombolysis. We review a unique case of early bi-leaflet mechanical heart valve (BMHV) dysfunction where the patient rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock requiring emergent re-do mitral valve surgery. Intraoperatively, the valve leaflets were found to be almost completely immobile secondary to thrombus formation directly on the hinges of the valve. This case demonstrates how the leaflet orientation of a BMHV affects transmitral flow and fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we also discuss left atrial vortex formation in the setting of atrial fibrillation, kinetic energy transfer through an anatomically implanted mechanical mitral valve, and their roles in contributing to early prosthetic valve thrombosis despite adequate anticoagulation.","Deng Yi, Belfar Alexandra, Powell Thomas",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2019,31072708,,10.1053/j.jvca.2019.03.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31072708,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

The Perioperative Care of Older Patients.,"Elderly patients are a growing and vulnerable group with an elevated perioperative risk. Perioperative treatment pathways that take these patients' special risks and requirements into account are often not implemented in routine clinical practice. This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, the AWMF guideline database, and the Cochrane database for guidelines from Germany and abroad, meta-analyses, and Cochrane reviews. The care of elderly patients who need surgery calls for an interdisciplinary, interprofessional treatment concept. One component of this concept is preoperative preparation of the patient (""prehabilitation""), which is best initiated before hospital admission, e.g., correction of deficiency states, optimization of chronic drug treatment, and respiratory training. Another important component consists of pre-, intra-, and postoperative measures to prevent delirium, which can lower the frequency of this complication by 30-50%: these include orientation aids, avoidance of inappropriate drugs for elderly patients, adequate analgesia, early mobilization, short fasting times, and a perioperative nutrition plan. Preexisting cognitive impairment predisposes to postoperative delirium (odds ratios [OR] ranging from 2.5 to 4.5). Frailty is the most important predictor of the postoperative course (OR: 2.6-11). It follows that preoperative assessment of the patient's functional and cognitive status is essential. The evidence-based and guideline-consistent care of elderly patients requires not only close interdisciplinary, interprofessional, and cross-sectoral collaboration, but also the restructuring and optimization of habitual procedural pathways in the hospital. Elderly patients' special needs can only be met by a treatment concept in which the entire perioperative phase is considered as a single, coherent process.","Olotu Cynthia, Weimann Arved, Bahrs Christian, Schwenk Wolfgang, Scherer Martin, Kiefmann Rainer",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,2019,30950385,PMC6444041,10.3238/arztebl.2019.0063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30950385,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6444041,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Nocebo Effects on Muscular Performance - An Experimental Study About Clinical Situations.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Nocebo effects are not only seen in studies of pharmacology and placebo/nocebo research but also in clinical everyday situations. For generation of objective and quantitative data on the impact of negative communication we have evaluated the immediate effects of common sentences, non-verbal signals and situations in the medical context on muscular performance. <b>Methods:</b> In an experimental study, 46 volunteers were tested by dynamometry of the deltoid muscle group to evaluate the maximal muscular strength during arm abduction. Baseline values were compared to performance after exposure to 18 verbal and non-verbal suggestions. Suggestions suspected to be negative were alternated with and compared to positively formulated alternatives. <b>Results:</b> Verbal and non-verbal communication produced significant effects on muscular performance, resulting mainly in weakening. The decrease in muscle strength after risk information for informed consent (91.4% of baseline) was absent, when benefits of the treatment were named coincidently. The weakening effect of asking about ""pain"" and ""nausea"" (89.4%), and of the announcement of medical interventions (91.7%) could be avoided with alternative wording. Impairment of muscular performance was also observed with the nocebo-inducers negative memory (89.5%) or uncertain future (93.3%), in contrast to a positive memory or the orientation into the presence. Non-verbal suggestions like overhead anesthesia induction (89.9%), a transport in strict flat supine position (89.1%), or a view from the window to a parking lot (94.1%) significantly reduced maximal muscle strength, whereas face-to face induction, half-sitting position and a view into the landscape did not. 8 out of 9 tested clinical situations reduced maximal arm muscle strength significantly, whereas alternative formulations did not. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study describes a quick, simple and uniform test using objective measurement of maximal muscle strength to allow for identification, quantification, and comparison of negative suggestions, regardless of their specific content and effect. Muscle strength is a clinically relevant parameter with regard to early mobilization, risk of falling and sufficient breathing. Furthermore, the observed impairment of muscular performance could reflect a general ""weakening effect"" of negative suggestions. In addition, the test facilitates development and verification of appropriate alternatives to prevent nocebo effects in patients, thereby improving patient communication.","Zech Nina, Seemann Milena, Grzesiek Magdalena, Breu Anita, Seyfried Timo F, Hansen Ernil",Frontiers in pharmacology,2019,30914952,PMC6421283,10.3389/fphar.2019.00219,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30914952,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6421283,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Improving the Training Process of Anesthesiology Residents Through the Mentorship-Based Approach.,"Although mentoring has been accepted as an effective and nourishing component in medical learning, known mentoring programs for the residents are lacking in most countries. To evaluate the mentoring program for anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University, an examination was designed to explore the styles of mentoring programs, as well as the aims and outcome followed by such programs. In October 2016, Anesthesiology Department of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences enrolled all the nine educational wards in ""mentorship program"". Twelve members of the faculty were chosen to be mentor. This program contained: (a) Creating online groups for reporting, feedbacks, and problem-solving, (b) integrating each chapter of textbooks for studying program each month, (c) establishing formative and summative assessments (i.e., PMP, OSCE, multiple choice exams), (d) role-playing for stress management of level 4 residents. Our main objective was to provide the residents with the provision of mentors. The goals of our programs were: Arrange a safe environment to encourage and foster reflection, promote self-care and wellness, guide special development, provide a resource for residents pursuing control, enrich team constructing and problem-solving skills, and promotion in career counseling of anesthesia residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences enrolled in this program from 2014 to 2017. We retrospectively compared 2 periods before (2014 - 2015) and after (2016 - 2017) of monthly examination and educational conference. In the academic stage from 2014 - 2015, the overall first-time license rate for the IBA written QE was 7 of 14 (50%) and in the period of 2016 - 2017, the general rate was 11 of 14 (78%) and in the period of 2017 - 2018, it was 12 of 14 (85%). For each extra year experiencing the program, the odds ratio for passing IBA written QE was 1.7 (P < 0.05). The median Iranian Board of Anesthesiology In-Training Examination (IBAITE) percentile was considerably greater in period 2 than period 1 (P < 0.05). Also, there was a significant correlation between IBAITE score and first-time passing rates for the IBA written QE (0.55, P < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrated the clinical mentorship program as an effective method in improving theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents. Programmed mentorship could significantly improve the educational goal achievements for anesthesiology residents. Mentoring programs are needed to be more used; however, need to be assessed and evaluated, especially regarding the professional aspects of education. Medical schools could subsequently be assessed regarding the number and quality of their running mentorship programs as a quality improvement tool.","Dabbagh Ali, Massoudi Nilofar, Vosoghian Maryam, Mottaghi Kamran, Mirkheshti Alireza, Tajbakhsh Ardeshir, Sezari Parissa, Moshari Mohammadreza, Tabashi Soodeh",Anesthesiology and pain medicine,2019,30881915,PMC6412912,10.5812/aapm.88657,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30881915,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6412912,TRUE,"Mentorship-based approach including online groups for reporting and feedback, integrated textbook study programs, formative and summative assessments, and role-playing for stress management",Anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,"Improved theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents, increased passing rates for board examinations, and enhanced educational goal achievements",TRUE,"Mentorship program that includes creating online groups for reporting, feedbacks, and problem-solving, integrating each chapter of textbooks for studying program each month, establishing formative and summative assessments, and role-playing for stress management.",Anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,"Improvement in theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents, promotion in career counseling, enrichment of team constructing and problem-solving skills, and improvement in educational goal achievements."
Multiple functional neurosteroid binding sites on GABAA receptors.,"Neurosteroids are endogenous modulators of neuronal excitability and nervous system development and are being developed as anesthetic agents and treatments for psychiatric diseases. While gamma amino-butyric acid Type A (GABAA) receptors are the primary molecular targets of neurosteroid action, the structural details of neurosteroid binding to these proteins remain ill defined. We synthesized neurosteroid analogue photolabeling reagents in which the photolabeling groups were placed at three positions around the neurosteroid ring structure, enabling identification of binding sites and mapping of neurosteroid orientation within these sites. Using middle-down mass spectrometry (MS), we identified three clusters of photolabeled residues representing three distinct neurosteroid binding sites in the human α1β3 GABAA receptor. Novel intrasubunit binding sites were identified within the transmembrane helical bundles of both the α1 (labeled residues α1-N408, Y415) and β3 (labeled residue β3-Y442) subunits, adjacent to the extracellular domains (ECDs). An intersubunit site (labeled residues β3-L294 and G308) in the interface between the β3(+) and α1(-) subunits of the GABAA receptor pentamer was also identified. Computational docking studies of neurosteroid to the three sites predicted critical residues contributing to neurosteroid interaction with the GABAA receptors. Electrophysiological studies of receptors with mutations based on these predictions (α1-V227W, N408A/Y411F, and Q242L) indicate that both the α1 intrasubunit and β3-α1 intersubunit sites are critical for neurosteroid action.","Chen Zi-Wei, Bracamontes John R, Budelier Melissa M, Germann Allison L, Shin Daniel J, Kathiresan Krishnan, Qian Ming-Xing, Manion Brad, Cheng Wayland W L, Reichert David E, Akk Gustav, Covey Douglas F, Evers Alex S",PLoS biology,2019,30845142,PMC6424464,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30845142,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6424464,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Identifying and Managing Intraoperative Arrhythmia: A Multidisciplinary Operating Room Team Simulation Case.,"Resuscitation of a critically ill patient is challenging for both novice learners and experienced health care providers. During a critical event, not only is it important to identify the correct underlying diagnosis, it is equally crucial that the appropriate Advance Cardiac Life Support algorithm, medications, and defibrillator modality are implemented. This scenario features a 56-year-old female who presents for excisional biopsy of an inguinal lymph node to evaluate lymphadenopathy concerning for lymphoma. Intraoperatively, she goes into cardiopulmonary arrest. Participants must identify and manage three different scenarios: (1) ventricular fibrillation, (2) unstable ventricular tachycardia, and (3) bradycardia, including the use of the defibrillator. Weekly simulation sessions were conducted in the in situ simulation operating room at Massachusetts General Hospital. Surgical residents, anesthesiology residents, nurses, and surgical technicians participated in a multidisciplinary operating room team. Each approximately 60-minute session included an orientation, the case, and the debriefing. Equipment included a simulation operating room with general surgery supplies, general anesthesia equipment, a high-fidelity SimMan patient simulator, a code cart, and a defibrillator. Ninety-one multidisciplinary participants completed this scenario from September to December 2015. Participants reported that the scenario was applicable to their clinical practice (96%), promoted teamwork skills (88%), and encouraged interprofessional learning (94%). Intraoperative cardiac arrest is a devastating event that can result in poor patient outcomes if the care team is not thoroughly prepared for crisis management. This simulation case scenario was implemented to train multidisciplinary learners in the identification and management of such an event.","Wongsirimeteekul Praelada, Mai Christine L, Petrusa Emil, Minehart Rebecca, Hemingway Maureen, Pian-Smith May, Eromo Ersne, Phitayakorn Roy",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2018,30800888,PMC6342395,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10688,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30800888,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342395,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Variability of repairable bicuspid aortic valve phenotypes: towards an anatomical and repair-oriented classification.,"The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) exists in a wide variety of valve phenotypes. The aim of this study was to assess the anatomical characteristics of the different phenotypes and develop a classification system to aid surgical repair. In 178 consecutive patients operated on for aortic insufficiency or aortic dilatation in 2 centres, 11 anatomical parameters of BAV were measured by echocardiography and intraoperatively. All BAV judged potentially repairable were included in the study. Commissural orientation correlated positively with fusion length (R2 = 0.6, P < 0.001) and negatively with non-functional commissure height (R2 = 0.45, P < 0.001). The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to their commissural orientation (type A: symmetrical, 160-180°, n = 73; type B: asymmetrical, 140-159°, n = 74; and type C: very asymmetrical, 120-139°, n = 31). The patterns of cusp fusion, annulus and aortic size were similar among the groups. Fusion length and the geometric height of the cusps decreased from type A to C; non-functional commissure height increased from type A to C (P < 0.05). Patient age increased from type A to type C. Isolated aortic dilatation was more frequent in type A, and severe aortic insufficiency was more frequent in types B and C (P < 0.05). Valve repair techniques and management of commissural orientation varied among the 3 groups (P < 0.05). Aortic valve replacement and residual aortic insufficiency after repair were more frequent in type C (P < 0.05). The BAV phenotypes follow a continuous spectrum that extends from symmetrical to very asymmetrical BAV. We describe the main anatomical parameters (including commissure orientation, length of fusion and non-functional commissure height) and their variation across this spectrum. We propose a new repair-oriented classification system based on those parameters that can be used to predict valve repair techniques. This classification needs further validation with regards to surgical techniques and long-term outcomes.","de Kerchove Laurent, Mastrobuoni Stefano, Froede Lennart, Tamer Saadallah, Boodhwani Munir, van Dyck Michel, El Khoury Gebrine, Schäfers Hans-Joachim",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019,30789231,,10.1093/ejcts/ezz033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30789231,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Managing creativity and compliance in the pursuit of patient safety.,"Are creativity and compliance mutually exclusive? In clinical settings, this question is increasingly relevant. Hospitals and clinics seek the creative input of their employees to help solve persistent patient safety issues, such as the prevention of bloodstream infections, while simultaneously striving for greater adherence to evidence-based guidelines and protocols. Extant research provides few answers about how creativity works in such contexts. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from employees in 24 different U.S.-based outpatient hemodialysis clinics. Linear mixed-effects models were utilized to test study hypotheses. Professional status, clinic climate variables, and interaction terms were modeled as fixed effects, with a random effect for clinic included in all models. Our results show that high status employees contributed more creative patient safety improvement ideas compared to low status employees. However, when high status employees were part of clinics with a stronger safety climate of compliance, they contributed fewer creative ideas compared to their counterparts working in clinics with a reduced compliance orientation. We also predicted low status employees working in less punitive clinics would contribute more creative ideas, but this hypothesis was not fully supported. This study suggests that in hospitals and clinics that rely on strict protocols and formal hierarchies to meet their goals, the factors that promote creativity may be distinctively context-dependent. Implications for theory, practice, as well as future directions for research examining creativity in healthcare and safety critical contexts are discussed.","Kim Sharon H, Weaver Sallie J, Yang Ting, Rosen Michael A",BMC health services research,2019,30755191,PMC6373136,10.1186/s12913-019-3935-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30755191,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6373136,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Potential for Drug Repositioning of Midazolam for Dentin Regeneration.,"Drug repositioning promises the advantages of reducing costs and expediting approvalschedules. An induction of the anesthetic and sedative drug; midazolam (MDZ), regulatesinhibitory neurotransmitters in the vertebrate nervous system. In this study we show the potentialfor drug repositioning of MDZ for dentin regeneration. A porcine dental pulp-derived cell line(PPU-7) that we established was cultured in MDZ-only, the combination of MDZ with bonemorphogenetic protein 2, and the combination of MDZ with transforming growth factor-beta 1. Thedifferentiation of PPU-7 into odontoblasts was investigated at the cell biological and genetic level.Mineralized nodules formed in PPU-7 were characterized at the protein and crystal engineeringlevels. The MDZ-only treatment enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity and mRNA levels ofodontoblast differentiation marker genes, and precipitated nodule formation containing a dentinspecificprotein (dentin phosphoprotein). The nodules consisted of randomly orientedhydroxyapatite nanorods and nanoparticles. The morphology, orientation, and chemicalcomposition of the hydroxyapatite crystals were similar to those of hydroxyapatite that hadtransformed from amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles, as well as the hydroxyapatite inhuman molar dentin. Our investigation showed that a combination of MDZ and PPU-7 cellspossesses high potential of drug repositioning for dentin regeneration.","Karakida Takeo, Onuma Kazuo, Saito Mari M, Yamamoto Ryuji, Chiba Toshie, Chiba Risako, Hidaka Yukihiko, Fujii-Abe Keiko, Kawahara Hiroshi, Yamakoshi Yasuo",International journal of molecular sciences,2019,30720745,PMC6387224,10.3390/ijms20030670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30720745,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387224,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Faculty-Focused Perioperative Ultrasound Training Program: A Single-Center Experience.,"Comprehensive educational initiatives in ultrasound for practicing physicians are lacking. We developed a perioperative ultrasound training program for faculty to offer a broad orientation to the principles and clinical applications of ultrasound. The program consisted of two phases. Phase one, which introduced ultrasound via didactic and hands-on components, had six live sessions. At the end of each, participants completed a knowledge quiz. During the sixth session, faculty participated in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). For phase two, faculty attended two to three sessions (8-10 hours each) of in-depth individualized training and demonstrated supervised performance of ultrasound-related procedures of their choice. Participants included Anesthesia faculty at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. On average 30 faculty members attended each live session for phase one; 12 completed phase two. There was a significant difference in quiz scores across the six sessions (p < 0.001) with scores for Session 6 being significantly higher than for Session 1 (p < 0.001). The average mean and median scores on the three OSCE stations were 95.63% and 98.33%, respectively. For phase two, the 8 participants who received training in regional anesthesia each performed > 10 blocks on patients over two days; 5 of the 7 participants who received training in transthoracic echocardiography each completed more than 15 examinations on simulators and 10 examinations on patients.

Health Professional Training and Capacity Strengthening Through International Academic Partnerships: The First Five Years of the Human Resources for Health Program in Rwanda.,"The Rwanda Human Resources for Health Program (HRH Program) is a 7-year (2012-2019) health professional training initiative led by the Government of Rwanda with the goals of training a large, diverse, and competent health workforce and strengthening the capacity of academic institutions in Rwanda. The data for this organizational case study was collected through official reports from the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MoH) and 22 participating US academic institutions, databases from the MoH and the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) in Rwanda, and surveys completed by the co-authors. In the first 5 years of the HRH Program, a consortium of US academic institutions has deployed an average of 99 visiting faculty per year to support 22 training programs, which are on track to graduate almost 4600 students by 2019. The HRH Program has also built capacity within the CMHS by promoting the recruitment of Rwandan faculty and the establishment of additional partnerships and collaborations with the US academic institutions. The milestones achieved by the HRH Program have been substantial although some challenges persist. These challenges include adequately supporting the visiting faculty; pairing them with Rwandan faculty (twinning); ensuring strong communication and coordination among stakeholders; addressing mismatches in priorities between donors and implementers; the execution of a sustainability strategy; and the decision by one of the donors not to renew funding beyond March 2017. Over the next 2 academic years, it is critical for the sustainability of the 22 training programs supported by the HRH Program that the health-related Schools at the CMHS significantly scale up recruitment of new Rwandan faculty. The HRH Program can serve as a model for other training initiatives implemented in countries affected by a severe shortage of health professionals.","Cancedda Corrado, Cotton Phil, Shema Joseph, Rulisa Stephen, Riviello Robert, Adams Lisa V, Farmer Paul E, Kagwiza Jeanne N, Kyamanywa Patrick, Mukamana Donatilla, Mumena Chrispinus, Tumusiime David K, Mukashyaka Lydie, Ndenga Esperance, Twagirumugabe Theogene, Mukara Kaitesi B, Dusabejambo Vincent, Walker Timothy D, Nkusi Emmy, Bazzett-Matabele Lisa, Butera Alex, Rugwizangoga Belson, Kabayiza Jean Claude, Kanyandekwe Simon, Kalisa Louise, Ntirenganya Faustin, Dixson Jeffrey, Rogo Tanya, McCall Natalie, Corden Mark, Wong Rex, Mukeshimana Madeleine, Gatarayiha Agnes, Ntagungira Egide Kayonga, Yaman Attila, Musabeyezu Juliet, Sliney Anne, Nuthulaganti Tej, Kernan Meredith, Okwi Peter, Rhatigan Joseph, Barrow Jane, Wilson Kim, Levine Adam C, Reece Rebecca, Koster Michael, Moresky Rachel T, O'Flaherty Jennifer E, Palumbo Paul E, Ginwalla Rashna, Binanay Cynthia A, Thielman Nathan, Relf Michael, Wright Rodney, Hill Mary, Chyun Deborah, Klar Robin T, McCreary Linda L, Hughes Tonda L, Moen Marik, Meeks Valli, Barrows Beth, Durieux Marcel E, McClain Craig D, Bunts Amy, Calland Forrest J, Hedt-Gauthier Bethany, Milner Danny, Raviola Giuseppe, Smith Stacy E, Tuteja Meenu, Magriples Urania, Rastegar Asghar, Arnold Linda, Magaziner Ira, Binagwaho Agnes",International journal of health policy and management,2018,30624876,PMC6326644,10.15171/ijhpm.2018.61,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624876,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6326644,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Halogen Substitution Influences Ketamine Metabolism by Cytochrome P450 2B6: In Vitro and Computational Approaches.,"Ketamine is analgesic at anesthetic and subanesthetic doses, and it has been used recently to treat depression. Biotransformation mediates ketamine effects, influencing both systemic elimination and bioactivation. CYP2B6 is the major catalyst of hepatic ketamine N-demethylation and metabolism at clinically relevant concentrations. Numerous CYP2B6 substrates contain halogens. CYP2B6 readily forms halogen-protein (particularly Cl-π) bonds, which influence substrate selectivity and active site orientation. Ketamine is chlorinated, but little is known about the metabolism of halogenated analogs. This investigation evaluated halogen substitution effects on CYP2B6-catalyzed ketamine analogs N-demethylation in vitro and modeled interactions with CYP2B6 using various computational approaches. Ortho phenyl ring halogen substituent changes caused substantial (18-fold) differences in K<sub>m</sub>, on the order of Br (bromoketamine, 10 μM) < Cl < F < H (deschloroketamine, 184 μM). In contrast, V<sub>max</sub> varied minimally (83-103 pmol/min/pmol CYP). Thus, apparent substrate binding affinity was the major consequence of halogen substitution and the major determinant of N-demethylation. Docking poses of ketamine and analogs were similar, sharing a π-stack with F297. Libdock scores were deschloroketamine < bromoketamine < ketamine < fluoroketamine. A Bayesian log K<sub>m</sub> model generated with Assay Central had a ROC of 0.86. The probability of activity at 15 μM for ketamine and analogs was predicted with this model. Deschloroketamine scores corresponded to the experimental K<sub>m</sub>, but the model was unable to predict activity with fluoroketamine. The binding pocket of CYP2B6 also suggested a hydrophobic component to substrate docking, on the basis of a strong linear correlation ( R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92) between lipophilicity ( Alog P) and metabolism (log K<sub>m</sub>) of ketamine and analogs. This property may be the simplest design criteria to use when considering similar compounds and CYP2B6 affinity.","Wang Pan-Fen, Neiner Alicia, Lane Thomas R, Zorn Kimberley M, Ekins Sean, Kharasch Evan D",Molecular pharmaceutics,2019,30589555,PMC9121441,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b01214,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30589555,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9121441,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Inadvertent posterior intercostal artery puncture and haemorrhage after ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block: a case report.,"This report describes one case of paravertebral haemorrhage after ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) that may have been attributed to the inadvertent puncture of the posterior intercostal artery (PIA). This complication has never been reported in ultrasound-guided TPVB. Strategies to prevent this potentially serious complication are discussed. A 52-year-old male underwent a video-assisted upper lobectomy. TPVB was performed under the guidance of ultrasound using the out-of-plane parasagittal approach. The transducer was placed 2.5 cm lateral to the midline area in a sagittal orientation. A needle was inserted at the lateral side of the transducer and advanced toward the T4 paravertebral space. During the final attempt, the needle tip was visualised in the middle area of the paravertebral space. Anterior displacement of the pleura was visualised upon injection of the saline. Aspiration of red blood was unfortunately identified. The block in this T4 level was discontinued. The patient was haemodynamically stable. When the chest cavity was entered, a bulging column-shaped haematoma was noted in the left paravertebral space extending from T1 to T12 with concomitant spread into the left T4-5 intercostal space. A postoperative neurological examination revealed intact sensory function in the T4 dermatome bilaterally. The patient fully recovered with no neurological sequelae. Ultrasound-guided TPVB still bears the potential risk of inadvertent PIA injury. We recommend colour Doppler imaging to identify PIA prior to the TPVB.","Song Linlin, Zhou Yin, Huang Da",BMC anesthesiology,2018,30577774,PMC6303859,10.1186/s12871-018-0667-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30577774,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303859,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Violence in video game produces a lower activation of limbic and temporal areas in response to social inclusion images.,"Exposure to violence in video games has been associated with a desensitization toward violent content, a decrease of empathy, and prosocial behavior. Moreover, violent video games seem to be related to a reduction of neural activation in the circuits linked to social emotional processing. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neural response to social inclusion images after violent and nonviolent video game playing. Electroencephalographic data of the 32 participants were recorded during a visual task with three presentations (T0, T1, T2) of 60 stimuli (30 social inclusion vs. 30 neutral images). After the T0 presentation, the participants played with a video game (orientation or violent). After the T1 presentation, the participants played with the other video game (orientation or violent). The two types of video games were randomly displayed. Event-related potential (ERP) components and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) were analyzed. The main findings showed a longer latency of the P2 component on occipito-temporal montage and a lower activation of the limbic and temporal areas in response to the social inclusion images post violent video game compared with the post orientation video game. The findings suggest a reduction of emotional engagement in social processing after playing violent video game.","Lai Carlo, Pellicano Gaia Romana, Altavilla Daniela, Proietti Alessio, Lucarelli Giada, Massaro Giuseppe, Luciani Massimiliano, Aceto Paola","Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",2019,30565058,,10.3758/s13415-018-00683-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30565058,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Common binding sites for cholesterol and neurosteroids on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel.,"Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and is required for mammalian pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) function. Computational studies suggest direct interactions between cholesterol and pLGICs but experimental evidence identifying specific binding sites is limited. In this study, we mapped cholesterol binding to Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a model pLGIC chosen for its high level of expression, existing crystal structure, and previous use as a prototypic pLGIC. Using two cholesterol analogue photolabeling reagents with the photoreactive moiety on opposite ends of the sterol, we identified two cholesterol binding sites: an intersubunit site between TM3 and TM1 of adjacent subunits and an intrasubunit site between TM1 and TM4. In both the inter- and intrasubunit sites, cholesterol is oriented such that the 3‑OH group points toward the center of the transmembrane domains rather than toward either the cytosolic or extracellular surfaces. We then compared this binding to that of the cholesterol metabolite, allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates pLGICs. The same binding pockets were identified for allopregnanolone and cholesterol, but the binding orientation of the two ligands was markedly different, with the 3‑OH group of allopregnanolone pointing to the intra- and extracellular termini of the transmembrane domains rather than to their centers. We also found that cholesterol increases, whereas allopregnanolone decreases the thermal stability of GLIC. These data indicate that cholesterol and neurosteroids bind to common hydrophobic pockets in the model pLGIC, GLIC, but that their effects depend on the orientation and specific molecular interactions unique to each sterol.","Budelier Melissa M, Cheng Wayland W L, Chen Zi-Wei, Bracamontes John R, Sugasawa Yusuke, Krishnan Kathiresan, Mydock-McGrane Laurel, Covey Douglas F, Evers Alex S",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The publication trend of neuropathic pain in the world and China: a 20-years bibliometric analysis.,"There has been tremendous change on neuropathic pain research in the past 20 years in China and around the world. We analyzed the global trend of neuropathic pain research and compared China's quantity and quality of neuropathic pain-related publications with other developed countries. Using terms ""neuropathic pain"", we retrieved related publications from the Web of Science (WOS) database and PubMed database. From different aspects, such as the number of papers, total citations, average citations per item, H-index, research types, orientation, institutions, journals and funding, global neuropathic pain publications were classified and analyzed. From 1998 to 2017, 21,733 articles regarding neuropathic pain research were published worldwide. Of these, 9.394% were contributed by authors from Chinese institutions, which followed USA and ranked second. However, the quality indicators of publications, including total citations, average citations per item and H-index, were relatively low in China.

[Continuous erector spinae plane block for postoperative analgesia of multiple rib fracture surgery: case report].,"The erector spinae plane block is a newly described and effective interfascial plane block for thoracic and abdominal surgery. This case report describes a patient with multiple rib fractures undergoing ultrasound-guided continuous erector spinae plane block for analgesia. A 37-year-old male patient was taken for surgical fixation of multiple rib fractures. At the end of the surgery, using ultrasound-guided longitudinal parasagittal orientation 3 cm to the lateral aspect of the T5 spinous process and an in-plane technique, 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine was administered between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse process, and a catheter was then inserted in the same plane. Before the end of surgery, 1 g paracetamol and 50 mg dexketoprofen were administered. Postoperative analgesia was applied with patient controlled analgesia method using 0.25% bupivacaine via the catheter. The patient's Visual Analogue Scale score at rest in the first 24 h was 0. The patient was monitored for 3 days with Visual Analogue Scale < 4, and the catheter was removed on postoperative day 4. No opioid requirement other than paracetamol and dexketoprofen occurred during this time. No postoperative complications were recorded. The erector spinae plane block is an alternative to paravertebral, intercostal, epidural or other regional techniques. It may be a suitable technique in anesthesia and algology practice due to providing analgesia in the postoperative period with a catheter in the erector spinae plane.","Yayik Ahmet Murat, Ahiskalioglu Ali, Çelik Erkan Cem, Ay Aysenur, Ozenoglu Atila",Brazilian journal of anesthesiology (Elsevier),2019,30392675,PMC9391790,10.1016/j.bjan.2018.08.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30392675,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9391790,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Tracheal Intubation: The Proof is in the Bevel.,"Efficient airway management is paramount in emergency medicine. Our experience teaching tracheal intubation has consistently identified gaps in the understanding of important issues. Here we discuss the importance of the endotracheal tube (ETT) bevel in airway management. The ETT bevel orientation is the main determinant of which mainstem bronchus the ETT enters when advanced too distally, despite a common belief that attributes a higher incidence of right mainstem bronchial intubation to the straighter angle sustained by the right mainstem bronchus. Likewise, a bougie- or fiberscope-assisted tracheal intubation can be impeded by the ETT tip hooking onto laryngeal structures; a 90-degree counterclockwise turn of the ETT (such that the bevel is facing posteriorly) prior to advancing it toward the larynx produces a first-pass success rate of 100%. Similarly, a posterior-facing bevel is believed to improve the ease of passage through the back of the nasal cavity when performing nasotracheal intubation. If resistance is met after the ETT tip has reached the laryngeal vicinity, further counterclockwise rotation may change the plane and incident angle of the ETT tip, facilitating passage through the vocal cords. Clockwise twisting of the ETT reduces the incident angle in the sagittal plane, thereby facilitating videolaryngoscopy-assisted tracheal intubation. Finally, a posterior-facing ETT bevel is the least likely to intubate a tracheoesophageal fistula. Understanding the implications of the ETT bevel direction may significantly change the efficiency of deliberate endobronchial, nasal, and bougie/fiberscope-, and videolaryngoscope-assisted intubations, and while managing the patient with a tracheoesophageal fistula.","Ho Anthony M-H, Ho Adrienne K, Mizubuti Glenio B",The Journal of emergency medicine,2018,30316622,,10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.09.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30316622,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Assessment of Myocardial Perfusion at Rest and During Stress Using Dynamic First-Pass Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Healthy Dogs.,"<b>Objective:</b> To assess the feasibility of myocardial perfusion analysis in healthy dogs using dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) imaging at rest and during simulated stress with two doses of adenosine. <b>Animals:</b> Ten healthy beagle dogs. <b>Procedures:</b> Dogs were anesthetized and positioned in dorsal recumbency in a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner. Electrocardiogram-triggered dynamic T1-weighted ultrafast gradient echo images of three slices in short-axis orientation of the heart were acquired during breath holds and the first pass of gadolinium contrast. Image acquisition was performed after 4 min infusion of 140 μg/kg/min and 280 μg/kg/min adenosine and, after a washout period, without adenosine, respectively. Images were processed by dividing each slice into 6 radial segments and perfusion analysis was performed from signal intensity-time data. <b>Results:</b> No differences in perfusion parameters were found between segments within any of the slices, but significant differences were found between slices for peak enhancement, accumulated enhancement, and the maximum upslope. In addition, significant differences were found within each slice between data at rest and during adenosine-induced stress for the relative and absolute maximum upslope, relative peak enhancement, time to peak, and accumulated enhancement although inter-individual variation was large and no difference was found between the two stress tests for some parameters. <b>Conclusion and Clinical Relevance:</b> Results of this study showed that rest and stress myocardial perfusion can be assessed using DCE-CMR in dogs using the methods described. Both, adenosine dose and slice appear to affect perfusion parameters in healthy dogs and individual response to adenosine was variable.","Richter Henning, Kircher Patrick R, Joerger Fabiola B, Bruellmann Erika, Dennler Matthias",Frontiers in veterinary science,2018,30234137,PMC6131641,10.3389/fvets.2018.00211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30234137,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131641,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effects of Temporary Functional Deafferentation in Chronic Stroke Patients: Who Profits More?,"Temporary functional deafferentation (TFD) by an anesthetic cream on the stroke-affected forearm was shown to improve sensorimotor abilities of stroke patients. The present study investigated different predictors for sensorimotor improvements during TFD and indicated outcome differences between patients grouped in subcortical lesions only and lesions with any cortical involvement. Thirty-four chronic stroke patients were temporarily deafferented on the more affected forearm by an anesthetic cream. Somatosensory performance was assessed using von Frey Hair and grating orientation task; motor performance was assessed by a shape-sorter-drum task. Seven potential predictors were entered into three linear multiple regression models. Furthermore, effects of TFD on outcome variables for the two groups (cortical versus subcortical lesion) were compared. Sex and sensory deficit were significant predictors for changes in motor function while age accounted for changes in grating orienting task. Males, patients with a stronger sensory deficit, and older patients profited more. None of the potential predictors made significant contributions to changes in threshold for touch. Furthermore, there were no differences in sensorimotor improvement between lesion site groups. The effects of TFD together with the low predictability of the investigated parameters suggest that characteristics of patients alone are not suitable to exclude some patients from TFD.","Sens Elisabeth, Franz Marcel, Preul Christoph, Meissner Winfried, Witte Otto W, Miltner Wolfgang H R, Weiss Thomas",Neural plasticity,2018,30151000,PMC6087564,10.1155/2018/7392024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30151000,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6087564,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Learning Preferences of First-Year Anesthesiology Residents During Their Orientation Month: A Single-Institution Study.,"As a step toward understanding whether learning preferences may benefit trainees and instructors, we studied the learning preferences, based on the VARK questionnaire, of anesthesiology residents during their orientation month to determine whether knowing their preferences influenced the educational resources they used. While resource utilization was similar for residents who knew their preferences and those who did not, residents overall used aural and read/write resources frequently. The learning preferences of 13 residents (72.2%) changed during the month. While further research is needed, this study provides insight into anesthesiology residents' learning styles.","Eosakul Stanley T, Wong Vanessa, Ku Cindy M, Mitchell John D",A&A practice,2019,30134254,,10.1213/XAA.0000000000000880,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30134254,,TRUE,Studying learning preferences using VARK questionnaire during orientation month,First-year anesthesiology residents,Understanding whether learning preferences influence educational resource utilization,TRUE,Understanding and utilizing learning preferences based on the VARK questionnaire during the orientation month,First-year anesthesiology residents,"Influence on the educational resources used by the residents, insight into anesthesiology residents' learning styles"
General anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia on the postoperative cognitive functions in pregnant women with dystocia.,"Effects of general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia on the postoperative cognitive functions in pregnant women with dystocia were investigated. Postoperative cognitive functions of 84 dystocia pregnant women treated with cesarean section were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who received general anesthesia were included in group A (n=42), and those who received general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia were included in group B (n=42). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS) at different time-points after anesthesia in the two groups of patients were observed and compared. Recovery of anesthesia such as the recovery time of spontaneous breathing, recovery time of orientation and time of eye opening were observed and compared between two groups of patients. Mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores were obtained and compared between the the groups of patients at different time-points after operation. Three vital signs (MAP, HR and BIS) were not significantly different between group A and B at the same time-point (P>0.05) and the maintenance of anesthesia was satisfactory. Compared with group A, postoperative recovery time of spontaneous breathing, recovery time of orientation and the time of eye opening in group B were all significantly shorter (P<0.05). In addition, MMSE scores of patients in group B, 2 and 12 h after operation were 24.33±1.61 and 26.41±1.83 points, respectively, which were significantly improved compared with those of patients in group A (20.45±1.58 and 22.39±1.72 points, respectively) (P<0.05). In conclusion, recovery of postoperative cognitive functions in pregnant women with dystocia who received general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia was shorter to that of those who only received general anesthesia.","Fu Min, Li Dongdong",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018,30112054,PMC6090460,10.3892/etm.2018.6277,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30112054,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6090460,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Mentor Mothers Zithulele: exploring the role of a peer mentorship programme in rural PMTCT care in Zithulele, Eastern Cape, South Africa.","<b>Background</b>: The majority of global HIV infections in children under 10 years of age occur during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding, despite improved coverage of 'prevention of mother-to-child transmission' (PMTCT) guidelines to reduce vertical transmission. This article looks closer at one community-based peer mentorship programme [Mentor Mothers Zithulele (MMZ)] in the Eastern Cape, South Africa which aims to supplement the existing heavily burdened antenatal programmes and improve PMTCT care.<b>Methods</b>: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HIV-positive women participating in MMZ and women receiving standard PMTCT care without any intervention. A focus group discussion (FGD) was conducted with women working as Mentor mothers (MMs) for MMZ to explore their experience of the impact of peer mentoring on the rural communities they serve.<b>Results</b>: Six main themes were identified in the interviews with antenatal patients: (i) MMs were a key educational resource, (ii) MMs were important in promoting exclusive breastfeeding, (iii) encouraging early HIV testing during pregnancy and (iv) providing psychosocial support to patients in their homes, thereby reducing stigma and sense of alienation. Respondents requested (v) additional focus on HIV education. MMs can (vi) function as a link between patients and health-care providers, improving treatment adherence. During the FGD two themes emerged; MMs fill the gap between patients and health services, and MMZ should focus on HIV awareness and stigma reduction.<b>Conclusion</b>: Peer mentoring programmes can play an important role in reducing vertical HIV transmission in resource-limited, rural settings by providing participants with education, psychosocial support, and a continuum of care.","Hamilton A Rebecca L, le Roux Karl W du Pré, Young Catherine W, Södergård Björn",Paediatrics and international child health,2020,30102134,,10.1080/20469047.2018.1474697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30102134,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Canadian Traumatic Brain Injury Research Consortium: Epitomizing Collaborative Research in Canada.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death in the first half of life and a chronic disability for Canadians of all ages. Despite the recognized importance of TBI, there is no integrated national strategy for research and best practices in Canada. We therefore created the Canadian TBI Research Consortium (CTRC) to build an ideal model of collaboration between Canadian TBI researchers. Our objectives were to: (1) Create a collaborative Canadian research network, (2) improve patient survival, functional outcome, and health through sustainable and scalable evidence-based practice implementation, (3) strengthen the healthcare system for patients with TBI, (4) provide international leadership and collaboration in TBI research, (5) build stronger links with patients and their representatives to help set the research agenda, and to participate in analysis of its impacts, and (6) support current researchers and prepare the next generation of leaders in TBI research. Building on the highly successful 30-year history of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, we developed a highly collaborative research group that integrates the multi-disciplinary network of TBI researchers in Canada. The CTRC conducts multi-center clinically relevant practice changing research. Our research is developed around investigator-led project-based research using a programmatic approach and multiple methodologies. Through strong and sustainable career development and mentorship programs, we train and develop the next generation of TBI researchers. Our group is composed of more than 100 Canadian researchers from coast to coast, most of them funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and other granting agencies. In conclusion, the CTRC prioritizes investigator-led TBI research and broadens the research agenda by integrating researchers from different disciplines in the field of TBI research to optimize delivery of care and improve the health of Canadians with TBI. Our goals are being accomplished across the whole continuum of care by conducting clinically relevant and practice-changing research.","Hutchison James S, Emery Carolyn, Gagnon Isabelle, Léger Caroline, Riopelle Richard, Wellington Cheryl, Wilson Elisa, Turgeon Alexis F",Journal of neurotrauma,2018,30074867,,10.1089/neu.2018.5871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30074867,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Program Director Survey of the Clinical Base Year in Anesthesiology Residency Programs.,"To maintain compliance with the current shift towards competency-based milestone assessment in graduate medical education, residency training programs must reflect this emphasis in their curricula starting with the intern year of training.1 In working towards collaborative efforts in curricular development between Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) anesthesiology residency programs, understanding the structure and design of the clinical base year for anesthesiology residency programs nationwide will serve as a valuable initial step. Anonymous online surveys were sent to anesthesiology residency program directors to collect data regarding their program's anesthesiology clinical base year (CBY) required, elective, and novel rotations. The survey was also designed to characterize the educational resources provided by the department, changes in the design of the clinical base year, and the feedback received from interns or other rotation department heads. Thirty-nine out of 130 US anesthesiology residency program directors responded (30%). The majority of respondents (87%) provide an in-house categorical intern CBY with a majority of those (94%) including a month dedicated to anesthesiology, during which some form of mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff was provided. The majority of respondents with anesthesiology exposure stated that they provide educational resources such as textbook materials (82%) or simulation sessions (89%) to their residents. With the evolution of the role of the anesthesiologist, advancements in biotechnology, and newly created board examinations, it is imperative that the CBY prepares rising anesthesiology residents to meet these demands. Results from this survey study can serve as the initial step in improving the clinical base year structure for anesthesiology residents nationally. Collaborative efforts can be undertaken to better incorporate clinical competency, feedback mechanisms, and educational tools through the collection of experiential evidence of successful strategies as well as challenges faced by program directors nationwide.","Streiff Agathe, Orlando Barbara, Mahoney Bryan",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2018,29928666,PMC5993005,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29928666,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993005,TRUE,"Mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff during a dedicated anesthesiology month in the clinical base year, with educational resources including textbook materials and simulation sessions",Anesthesiology interns/residents in their clinical base year,"Better preparation of rising anesthesiology residents through improved clinical base year structure incorporating clinical competency, feedback mechanisms, and educational tools",TRUE,"The onboarding strategy includes a clinical base year with a month dedicated to anesthesiology, during which some form of mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff is provided.

A thumbwheel mechanism for APOA1 activation of LCAT activity in HDL.,"APOA1 is the most abundant protein in HDL. It modulates interactions that affect HDL's cardioprotective functions, in part via its activation of the enzyme, LCAT. On nascent discoidal HDL, APOA1 comprises 10 α-helical repeats arranged in an anti-parallel stacked-ring structure that encapsulates a lipid bilayer. Previous chemical cross-linking studies suggested that these APOA1 rings can adopt at least two different orientations, or registries, with respect to each other; however, the functional impact of these structural changes is unknown. Here, we placed cysteine residues at locations predicted to form disulfide bonds in each orientation and then measured APOA1's ability to adopt the two registries during HDL particle formation. We found that most APOA1 oriented with the fifth helix of one molecule across from fifth helix of the other (5/5 helical registry), but a fraction adopted a 5/2 registry. Engineered HDLs that were locked in 5/5 or 5/2 registries by disulfide bonds equally promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages, indicating functional particles. However, unlike the 5/5 registry or the WT, the 5/2 registry impaired LCAT cholesteryl esterification activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001), despite LCAT binding equally to all particles. Chemical cross-linking studies suggest that full LCAT activity requires a hybrid epitope composed of helices 5-7 on one APOA1 molecule and helices 3-4 on the other. Thus, APOA1 may use a reciprocating thumbwheel-like mechanism to activate HDL-remodeling proteins.","Cooke Allison L, Morris Jamie, Melchior John T, Street Scott E, Jerome W Gray, Huang Rong, Herr Andrew B, Smith Loren E, Segrest Jere P, Remaley Alan T, Shah Amy S, Thompson Thomas B, Davidson W Sean",Journal of lipid research,2018,29773713,PMC6027914,10.1194/jlr.M085332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29773713,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6027914,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
ERM for Health Care Organizations: An Economic Enterprise Risk Management Innovation Program (E<sup>2</sup>RM<sub>health care</sub>).,"In recent years, health care organizations have looked to enterprise risk management (ERM) for novel systems to obtain more accurate data on which to base risk strategies. This study proposes a conceptual ERM framework specifically designed for health care organizations. We explore how hospitals in the United States and Brazil are structuring and implementing ERM processes within their management structure. This study incorporates interviews with 15 chief risk officers (8 from the United States and 7 from Brazil) with qualitative data analysis using NVivo (QSR International software). The interviews confirm that adopting ERM for health care organizations has gained momentum and become a priority, and that the demand for risk economic assessment orientation is common among health care risk managers. We propose an ERM model for health care (Economic Enterprise Risk Management in Health Care) divided into four maturity levels and complemented by an implementation timeline. The model is accompanied by guidelines to orient the gradual implementation of ERM, including orientation to perform risk economic assessment.","da Silva Etges Ana Paula Beck, Grenon Veronique, de Souza Joana Siqueira, Kliemann Neto Francisco José, Felix Elaine Aparecida",Value in health regional issues,2018,29772471,,10.1016/j.vhri.2018.03.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29772471,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Moving anesthesiology educational resources to the point of care: experience with a pediatric anesthesia mobile app.,"Educators in all disciplines recognize the need to update tools for the modern learner. Mobile applications (apps) may be useful, but real-time data is needed to demonstrate the patterns of utilization and engagement amongst learners. We examined the use of an anesthesia app by two groups of learners (residents and anesthesiologist assistant students [AAs]) during a pediatric anesthesiology rotation. The app calculates age and weight-based information for clinical decision support and contains didactic materials for self-directed learning. The app transmitted detailed usage information to our research team. Over a 12-month period, 39 participants consented; 30 completed primary study procedures (18 residents, 12 AAs). AAs used the app more frequently than residents (P = 0.025) but spent less time in the app (P < 0.001). The median duration of app usage was 2.3 minutes. During the course of the rotation, usage of the app decreased over time. 'Succinylcholine' was the most accessed drug, while 'orientation' was the most accessed teaching module. Ten (33%) believed that the use of apps was perceived to be distracting by operating room staff and surgeons. Real-time in-app analytics helped elucidate the actual usage of this educational resource and will guide future decisions regarding development and educational content. Further research is required to determine learners' preferred choice of device, user experience, and content in the full range of clinical and nonclinical purposes.","Monroe Katherine S, Evans Michael A, Mukkamala Shivani G, Williamson Julie L, Jabaley Craig S, Mariano Edward R, O'Reilly-Shah Vikas N",Korean journal of anesthesiology,2018,29739184,PMC5995022,10.4097/kja.d.18.00014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29739184,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5995022,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Auditory Icon Alarms Are More Accurately and Quickly Identified than Current Standard Melodic Alarms in a Simulated Clinical Setting.,"Current standard audible medical alarms are difficult to learn and distinguish from one another. Auditory icons represent a new type of alarm that has been shown to be easier to learn and identify in laboratory settings by lay subjects. In this study, we test the hypothesis that icon alarms are easier to learn and identify than standard alarms by anesthesia providers in a simulated clinical setting. Twenty anesthesia providers were assigned to standard or icon groups. Experiments were conducted in a simulated intensive care unit. After a brief group-specific alarm orientation, subjects identified patient-associated alarm sounds during the simulation and logged responses via a tablet computer. Each subject participated in the simulation twice and was exposed to 32 alarm annunciations. Primary outcome measures were response accuracy and response times. Secondary outcomes included assessments of perceived fatigue and task load. Overall accuracy rate in the standard alarm group was 43% (mean) and in the icon group was 88% (mean). Subjects in the icon group were 26.1 (odds ratio [98.75% CI, 8.4 to 81.5; P < 0.001]) times more likely to correctly identify an alarm. Response times in the icon group were shorter than in the standard alarm group (12 vs. 15 s, difference 3 s [98.75% CI ,1 to 5; P < 0.001]).

Pressure Distribution in the Ankle and Subtalar Joint With Routine and Oversized Foot Orthoses.,"Foot orthoses are used to treat many disorders that affect the lower limb. These assistive devices have the potential to alter the forces, load distribution, and orientation within various joints in the foot and ankle. This study attempts to quantify the effects of orthoses on the intra-articular force distribution of the ankle and subtalar joint using a cadaveric testing jig to simulate weight bearing. Five lower-limb cadaveric specimens were placed on a custom jig, where a 334-N (75-lb) load was applied at the femoral head, and the foot was supported against a plate to simulate double-leg stance. Pressure-mapping sensors were inserted into the ankle and subtalar joint. Mean pressure, peak pressure, contact area, and center of force were measured in both the ankle and subtalar joints for barefoot and 2 medial foot orthosis conditions. The 2 orthosis conditions were performed using (1) a 1.5-cm-height wedge to simulate normal orthoses and (2) a 3-cm-height wedge to simulate oversized orthoses. The contact area experienced in the subtalar joint significantly decreased during 3-cm orthotic posting of the medial arch, but neither orthosis had a significant effect on the spatial mean pressure or peak pressure experienced in either joint. The use of an oversized orthosis could lead to a decrease in the contact area and alterations in the distribution of pressure within the subtalar joint. The use of inappropriate orthoses could negatively impact the force distribution in the lower limb.","Williamson Patrick, Lechtig Aron, Hanna Philip, Okajima Stephen, Biggane Peter, Nasr Michael, Zurakowski David, Duggal Naven, Nazarian Ara",Foot & ankle international,2018,29696991,,10.1177/1071100718770659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29696991,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Comprehensive Onboarding and Orientation Plan for Neurocritical Care Advanced Practice Providers.,"As the role of advanced practice providers (APPs) expands to include increasingly complex patient care within the intensive care unit, the educational needs of these providers must also be expanded. An onboarding process was designed for APPs in the neurocritical care service line. Onboarding for new APPs revolved around 5 specific areas: candidate selection, proctor assignment, 3-phased orientation process, remediation, and mentorship. To ensure effective training for APPs, using the most time-conscious approach, the backbone of the process is a structured curriculum. This was developed and integrated within the standard orientation and onboarding process. The curriculum design incorporated measurable learning goals, objective assessments of phased goal achievements, and opportunities for remediation. The neurocritical care service implemented an onboarding process in 2014. Four APPs (3 nurse practitioners and 1 physician assistant) were employed by the department before the implementation of the orientation program. The length of employment ranged from 1 to 4 years. Lack of clinical knowledge and/or sufficient training was cited as reasons for departure from the position in 2 of the 4 APPs, as either self-expression or peer evaluation. Since implementation of this program, 12 APPs have completed the program, of which 10 remain within the division, creating an 83% retention rate. The onboarding process, including a 3-phased, structured orientation plan for neurocritical care, has increased APP retention since its implementation. The educational model, along with proctoring and mentorship, has improved clinical knowledge and increased nurse practitioner retention. A larger-scale study would help to support the validity of this onboarding process.","Langley Tamra M, Dority Jeremy, Fraser Justin F, Hatton Kevin W",The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,2018,29621072,,10.1097/JNN.0000000000000359,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29621072,,TRUE,"A comprehensive onboarding process with 5 specific areas: candidate selection, proctor assignment, 3-phased orientation process, remediation, and mentorship, supported by a structured curriculum with measurable learning goals and objective assessments",Advanced practice providers (APPs) in neurocritical care,Increased APP retention and improved clinical knowledge,FALSE,,,
Exploring conformational states and helical packings in the P2X receptor transmembrane domain by molecular dynamics simulation.,"The P2X receptor is a trimeric transmembrane protein that acts as an ATP-gated ion channel. Its transmembrane domain (TMD) contains only six helices and three of them, the M2 helices, line the ion conduction pathway. Here, using molecular dynamics simulation, I identify four conformational states of the TMD that are associated with four types of packing between M2 helices. Packing in the extracellular half of the M2 helix produces closed conformations, while packing in the intracellular half produces both open and closed conformations. State transition is observed and supports a mechanism where iris-like twisting of the M2 helices switches the location of helical packing between the extracellular and the intracellular halves of the helices. In addition, this twisting motion alters the position and orientation of residue side-chains relative to the pore and therefore influences the pore geometry and possibly ion permeation. Helical packing, on the other hand, may restrict the twisting motion and generate discrete conformational states.",Li Guo-Hua,Journal of biological physics,2018,29611030,PMC6082803,10.1007/s10867-018-9493-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29611030,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082803,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Patient-Specific Atrial Hemodynamics of a Double Lumen Neonatal Cannula in Correct Caval Position.,"Clinical success of pediatric veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is associated with the double lumen cannula cardiovascular device design as well as its anatomic orientation in the atrium. The positions of cannula ports with respect to the vena cavae and the tricuspid valve are believed to play a significant role on device hemodynamics. Despite various improvements in ECMO catheters, especially for the neonatal and congenital heart patients, it is still challenging to select a catalogue size that would fit to most patients optimally. In effect, the local unfavorable blood flow characteristics of the cannula would translate to an overall loss of efficiency of the ECMO circuit. In this study, the complex flow regime of a neonatal double lumen cannula, positioned in a patient-specific right atrium, is presented for the first time in literature. A pulsatile computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver that is validated for cardiovascular device flow regimes was used to perform the detailed flow, oxygenated blood transport, and site-specific blood damage analysis using an integrated cannula and right atrium model. A standard 13Fr double lumen cannula was scanned using micro-CT, reconstructed and simulated under physiologic flow conditions. User defined scalar transport equations allowed the quantification of the mixing and convection of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood as well as blood residence times and hemolysis build-up. Site-specific CFD analysis provided key insight into the hemodynamic challenges encountered in cannula design and the associated intra-atrial flow patterns. Due to neonatal flow conditions, an ultra high velocity infusion jet emanated from the infusion port and created a zone of major recirculation in the atrium. This flow regime influenced the delivery of the oxygenated blood to the tricuspid valve. Elevated velocities and complex gradients resulted in higher wall shear stresses (WSS) particularly at the infusion port having the highest value followed by the aspiration hole closest to the drainage port. Our results show that, in a cannula that is perfectly oriented in the atrium, almost 38% of the oxygenated blood is lost to the atrial circulation while only half of the blood from inferior vena cava (IVC) can reach to the tricuspid valve. As such, approximately 6% of venous blood from superior vena cava (SVC) can be delivered to tricuspid. High values of hemolysis index were observed with blood damage encountered around infusion hole (0.025%). These results warrant further improvements in the cannula design to achieve optimal performance of ECMO and better patient outcomes.","Muhammad Jamil, Rezaeimoghaddam Mohammad, Cakmak Bilgesu, Rasooli Reza, Salihoglu Ece, Yıldız Yahya, Pekkan Kerem",Artificial organs,2018,29572879,PMC5947122,10.1111/aor.13127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29572879,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5947122,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Are Short Subspecialty Courses the Educational Answer?,"There is an urgent need to train more anesthesia providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is also a need to provide more educational opportunities in subspecialty areas of anesthetic practice such as trauma management, pain management, obstetric anesthesia, and pediatric anesthesia.

"Can Recognition of Spinal Ischemia Be Improved? Application of Motor-Evoked Potentials, Serum Markers, and Breath Gas Analysis in an Acutely Instrumented Pig Model.","Paraplegia due to spinal cord ischemia (SCI) is a serious complication after repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. For prevention and early treatment of spinal ischemia, intraoperative monitoring of spinal cord integrity is essential. This study was intended to improve recognition of SCI through a combination of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (tc-MEPs), serum markers, and innovative breath analysis. In 9 female German Landrace pigs, tc-MEPs were captured, markers of neuronal damage were determined in blood, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analyzed in exhaled air. After thoraco-phrenico-laparotomy, SCI was initiated through sequential clamping (n = 4) or permanently ligating (n = 5) SAs of the abdominal and thoracic aorta in caudocranial orientation until a drop in the tc-MEPs to at least 25% of the baseline was recorded. VOCs in breath were determined by means of solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. After waking up, clinical and neurological status was evaluated (Tarlov score). Spinal cord histology was obtained in postmortem. Permanent vessel ligature induced a worse neurological outcome and a higher number of necrotic motor neurons compared to clamping. Changes of serum markers remained unspecific. After laparotomy, exhaled acetone and isopropanol showed highest concentrations, and pentane and hexane increased during ischemia-reperfusion injury. To mimic spinal ischemia occurring in humans during aortic aneurysm repair, animal models have to be meticulously evaluated concerning vascular anatomy and function. Volatiles from breath indicated metabolic stress during surgery and oxidative damage through ischemia reperfusion.

Here, we investigated the mechanisms involved in signal relay to the αI domain, including whether binding of the ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to the αI domain is linked to headpiece opening and engenders a preferred αI domain orientation. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and negative-stain EM, we define structures of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and their complex, and the effect of activation by Mn<sup>2+</sup> Headpiece opening was substantially stabilized by substitution of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and became complete upon ICAM-1 addition. These agents stabilized αI-headpiece orientation, resulting in a well-defined orientation of ICAM-1 such that its tandem Ig-like domains pointed in the opposite direction from the β-subunit leg of LFA-1. Mutations in the integrin βI domain α1/α1' helix stabilizing either the open or the closed βI-domain conformation indicated that α1/α1' helix movements are linked to ICAM-1 binding by the αI domain and to the extended-open conformation of the ectodomain. The LFA-1-ICAM-1 orientation described here with ICAM-1 pointing anti-parallel to the LFA-1 β-subunit leg is the same orientation that would be stabilized by tensile force transmitted between the ligand and the actin cytoskeleton and is consistent with the cytoskeletal force model of integrin activation.","Sen Mehmet, Koksal Adem C, Yuki Koichi, Wang Jianchuan, Springer Timothy A",The Journal of biological chemistry,2018,29507098,PMC5925802,10.1074/jbc.RA117.000710,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29507098,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5925802,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Ten-year clinical experience of humanitarian cardiothoracic surgery in Rwanda: Building a platform for ultimate sustainability in a resource-limited setting.,"Despite its near complete eradication in resource-rich countries, rheumatic heart disease remains the most common acquired cardiovascular disease in sub-Saharan Africa. With a ratio of physicians/population of 1 per 10,500, including only 4 cardiologists for a population of 11.4 million, Rwanda represents a resource-limited setting lacking the local capacity to detect and treat early cases of strep throat and perform lifesaving operations for advanced rheumatic heart disease. Humanitarian surgical outreach in this region can improve the delivery of cardiovascular care by providing sustainability through mentorship, medical expertise, training, and knowledge transfer, and ultimately the creation of a cardiac center. We describe the experience of consecutive annual visits to Rwanda since 2008 and report the outcomes of a collaborative approach to enable sustainable cardiac surgery in the region. The Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index tool's Cardiac Version (http://www.uic.edu/orgs/qli/) was administered to assess the postoperative quality of life. Ten visits have been completed, performing 149 open procedures, including 200 valve implantations, New York Heart Association class III or IV, with 4.7% 30-day mortality. All procedures were performed with the participation of local Rwandan personnel, expatriate physicians, nurses, residents, and support staff. Early complications included cerebrovascular accident (n = 4), hemorrhage requiring reoperation (n = 6), and death (n = 7). Quality of life was assessed to further understand challenges encountered after cardiac surgery in this resource-limited setting. Four major domains were considered: health and functioning, social and economic, psychologic/spiritual, and family. The mean total quality of life index was 20.79 ± 4.07 on a scale from 0 to 30, for which higher scores indicated higher quality of life. Women had significantly lower ""social and economic"" subscores (16.81 ± 4.17) than men (18.64 ± 4.10) (P < .05). Patients who reported receiving their follow-up care in rural health centers also had significantly lower ""social and economic"" subscores (15.67 ± 3.81) when compared with those receiving follow-up care in urban health facilities (18.28 ± 4.16) (P < .005). Value afforded to family and psychologic factors remained high among all groups. Major postsurgical challenges faced included barriers to follow-up and systemic anticoagulation. This report represents the first account of a long-term humanitarian effort to develop sustainability in cardiac surgery in a resource-limited setting, Rwanda. With the use of volunteer teams to deliver care, transfer knowledge, and mentor local personnel, the results demonstrate superior outcomes and favorable indices of quality of life. The credibility gained over a decade of effort has created the opportunity for a partnership with Rwanda to establish a dedicated center of cardiac care to assist in mitigating the burden of cardiovascular disease throughout sub-Saharan Africa.","Swain JaBaris D, Sinnott Colleen, Breakey Suellen, Hasson Charles Rian, Mody Gita, Nyirimanzi Napthal, Patton-Bolman Ceeya, Come Patricia, Ganza Gapira, Rusingiza Emmanuel, Ruhamya Nathan, Mucumbitsi Joseph, Borges Jorge, Zammert Martin, Muehlschlegel Jochen D, Oakes Robert, Leavitt Bruce, Bolman R Morton",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2018,29499865,,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.11.106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29499865,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Humanitarian surgical outreach providing sustainability through mentorship, medical expertise, training, and knowledge transfer","Local Rwandan personnel, expatriate physicians, nurses, residents, and support staff","Creation of a cardiac center, improved delivery of cardiovascular care, development of sustainable cardiac surgery in a resource-limited setting, superior outcomes and favorable indices of quality of life"
The role of feedback in ameliorating burnout.,"Assessment of the current literature surrounding interventions directed toward the prevention of burnout in the field of medicine and particularly in anesthesiology. Recently, burnout has been noted to lead to medication errors and subsequently increased harm to our patients. On a personal level, burnout can lead to depression and even suicide amongst physicians. Strategies to prevent burnout amongst anesthesiologists that have been studied in the literature include multisource feedback, mentorship and early recognition. There remains no clear or definitive intervention to prevent burnout for physicians. However, changing our environment to embrace mentorship, the continual exchange of feedback and the fostering self-care could startlingly improve our work environment.","Gordon Emily K, Baranov Dimitry Y, Fleisher Lee A",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2018,29461263,,10.1097/ACO.0000000000000583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29461263,,TRUE,mentorship and multisource feedback,anesthesiologists,"prevention of burnout, improved work environment, reduction in medication errors",TRUE,"multisource feedback, mentorship and early recognition",anesthesiologists,"prevention of burnout, improvement of work environment"
Impact of age on the anatomy of the pediatric pterygopalatine fossa and its relationship to the suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block.,"The suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block is associated with improved post-operative pain management after select craniofacial surgical procedures. This study's objective is to better define the impact of pediatric facial skeletal growth on techniques for accessing the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF). Pediatric patients with prior thin-slice maxillofacial computed tomography imaging were identified in an institutional radiology database. Aquarius image-processing software (Ver. 4.4.11, TeraRecon, Inc., Foster City, CA) was used to measure from the suprazygomatic skin to the greater wing of the sphenoid where the needle is then re-oriented in an anterior and inferior trajectory allowing it to advance into the PPF. A total of 90 patients ranging from 0 to ≤18 years of age were included in the study. The mean distance from the suprazygomatic skin to the foramen rotundum in patients 0 to ≤12 months of age and >13 to ≤18 years of age was 38.6 (SD ± 4.7) and 47.1 (SD ± 3.2) mm, respectively (p < .0001). The statistical analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between age in years and all of the measured distances (p = .0001). With respect to the plane of the needle entry site, the anterior and inferior angles required for passage into the PPF in the 0 to ≤12 months age group were 11 (SD ± 2.1) and 9.0 (SD ± 2.5) degrees, respectively, compared to those in the >13 to ≤18 years of age group at 12.4 (SD ± 1.9) and 12.1 (SD ± 3.2) degrees, respectively. These data reveal that patients in the oldest compared to the youngest pediatric age groups require significantly greater needle insertion, yet the angles of needle re-orientation are clinically similar between these two pediatric age groups varying by up to only 3°. As expected, the distance from the skin to the foramen rotundum increases significantly with age; however, the angles of re-orientation with respect to the original needle entry site demonstrated up to only 3° of variability between the youngest and oldest age groups evaluated in this pediatric cohort.","Marston Alexander P, Merritt Glenn, Morris Jonathan M, Cofer Shelagh A",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2018,29447826,,10.1016/j.ijporl.2017.12.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29447826,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Head movements and postures as pain behavior.,"Pain assessment can benefit from observation of pain behaviors, such as guarding or facial expression, and observational pain scales are widely used in clinical practice with nonverbal patients. However, little is known about head movements and postures in the context of pain. In this regard, we analyze videos of three publically available datasets. The BioVid dataset was recorded with healthy participants subjected to painful heat stimuli. In the BP4D dataset, healthy participants performed a cold-pressor test and several other tasks (meant to elicit emotion). The UNBC dataset videos show shoulder pain patients during range-of-motion tests to their affected and unaffected limbs. In all videos, participants were sitting in an upright position. We studied head movements and postures that occurred during the painful and control trials by measuring head orientation from video over time, followed by analyzing posture and movement summary statistics and occurrence frequencies of typical postures and movements. We found significant differences between pain and control trials with analyses of variance and binomial tests. In BioVid and BP4D, pain was accompanied by head movements and postures that tend to be oriented downwards or towards the pain site. We also found differences in movement range and speed in all three datasets. The results suggest that head movements and postures should be considered for pain assessment and research. As additional pain indicators, they possibly might improve pain management whenever behavior is assessed, especially in nonverbal individuals such as infants or patients with dementia. However, in advance more research is needed to identify specific head movements and postures in pain patients.","Werner Philipp, Al-Hamadi Ayoub, Limbrecht-Ecklundt Kerstin, Walter Steffen, Traue Harald C",PloS one,2018,29444153,PMC5812618,10.1371/journal.pone.0192767,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29444153,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812618,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Tracheal intubation through laryngeal mask airway CTrach™ with polyvinyl chloride tube: Comparison between two orientations of the tracheal tube.,"Higher success rate of intubation is observed with the reverse orientation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tracheal tube while intubating through laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Fastrach™. It is not clear whether the same is true during intubation through LMA CTrach™ visualizing the process of intubation. The primary aim of this study was to compare the influence of the PVC tracheal tube orientation on the success rate of intubation while intubating through LMA CTrach™. One-hundred and fifty patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomized to either group normal orientation or group reverse orientation. A maximum of 3 intubation attempts within a span of 3 min was allowed in each group before the change over to the other group. If intubation failed with the other orientation of the tube also, then intubation through LMA CTrach™ was abandoned and intubation done by direct laryngoscopy. The success of intubation, time, maneuvers, postoperative sore throat, and hoarseness were recorded. Tracheal intubation through LMA CTrach™ with PVC tube was successful in 94.5% of patients in group normal orientation and in 98.6% of patients in group reverse orientation. The first attempt success rate was 75.3% and 86.3% in group normal and group reverse orientation, respectively. The incidence of a sore throat was higher in the group normal orientation than in the reverse orientation (31.8% and 26.5%, respectively). Overall success rate of intubation was comparable between the two groups. Though statistically insignificant, the first attempt success rate was higher in group reverse orientation.","Pavani Karri, Krishna Handattu Mahabaleswara, Nandhini Joseph","Journal of anaesthesiology, clinical pharmacology",2017,29416239,PMC5791260,10.4103/0970-9185.222507,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29416239,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791260,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Content Analysis of How Sexual Behavior and Reproductive Health are Being Portrayed on Primetime Television Shows Being Watched by Teens and Young Adults.,"Television is a leading source of sexual education for teens and young adults, thus it is important to understand how sexual behavior and reproductive health are portrayed in popular primetime programming. This study is a media content analysis of the 19 top-rated scripted English-language primetime television shows aired between January 1, 2015 and May 31, 2015, and viewed by American youth audiences 12-24 years of age. The purpose of this study is to assess how sex/sexuality and reproductive health are being portrayed in a popular medium that reaches many adolescent and young adult audiences. Themes used for this analysis include youth pregnancy/parenting, mentoring/guidance of youth regarding sexual behavior, sex/sexuality, body image/identity, sexual violence/abuse/harassment, gender identity/sexual orientation, and reproductive health. Themes have been classified in one of the following six categories: visual cues, brief mentions, dialogue, minor storylines, major storylines, and multi-episode storylines. Our findings indicate that narratives providing educational information regarding the risks and consequences of sexual behavior were missing from the television shows we analyzed and that storylines promoting low risk sexual behavior were rare. Sexual violence and abuse, casual sex among adults, lack of contraception use, or no portrayal of consequences of risky behaviors were common. Compared to prior research, we found an emergent theme normalizing non-heterosexual gender identity and sexual orientation. Our findings have important implications as exposure to popular media shapes the perceptions and behaviors of teens and young adults. This study has the potential to shed light on the need to create stories and narratives in television shows watched by American teens and young adults with educational messages regarding the risks and consequences of sexual behavior.","Kinsler Janni J, Glik Deborah, de Castro Buffington Sandra, Malan Hannah, Nadjat-Haiem Carsten, Wainwright Nicole, Papp-Green Melissa",Health communication,2019,29388796,,10.1080/10410236.2018.1431020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29388796,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Mechanisms of Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation in Pain Suppression: A Computational Modeling Analysis.,"The mechanisms of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation for chronic pain remain unclear. The objective of this work was to explore the neurophysiological effects of DRG stimulation using computational modeling. Electrical fields produced during DRG stimulation were calculated with finite element models, and were coupled to a validated biophysical model of a C-type primary sensory neuron. Intrinsic neuronal activity was introduced as a 4 Hz afferent signal or somatic ectopic firing. The transmembrane potential was measured along the neuron to determine the effect of stimulation on intrinsic activity across stimulation parameters, cell location/orientation, and membrane properties. The model was validated by showing close correspondence in action potential (AP) characteristics and firing patterns when compared to experimental measurements. Subsequently, the model output demonstrated that T-junction filtering was amplified with DRG stimulation, thereby blocking afferent signaling, with cathodic stimulation at amplitudes of 2.8-5.5 × stimulation threshold and frequencies above 2 Hz. This amplified filtering was dependent on the presence of calcium and calcium-dependent small-conductance potassium channels, which produced a hyperpolarization offset in the soma, stem, and T-junction with repeated somatic APs during stimulation. Additionally, DRG stimulation suppressed somatic ectopic activity by hyperpolarizing the soma with cathodic or anodic stimulation at amplitudes of 3-11 × threshold and frequencies above 2 Hz. These effects were dependent on the stem axon being relatively close to and oriented toward a stimulating contact. These results align with the working hypotheses on the mechanisms of DRG stimulation, and indicate the importance of stimulation amplitude, polarity, and cell location/orientation on neuronal responses.","Kent Alexander R, Min Xiaoyi, Hogan Quinn H, Kramer Jeffery M",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018,29377442,,10.1111/ner.12754,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29377442,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Mapping two neurosteroid-modulatory sites in the prototypic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel GLIC.,"Neurosteroids are endogenous sterols that potentiate or inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) and can be effective anesthetics, analgesics, or anti-epileptic drugs. The complex effects of neurosteroids on pLGICs suggest the presence of multiple binding sites in these receptors. Here, using a series of novel neurosteroid-photolabeling reagents combined with top-down and middle-down mass spectrometry, we have determined the stoichiometry, sites, and orientation of binding for 3α,5α-pregnane neurosteroids in the <i>Gloeobacter</i> ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a prototypic pLGIC. The neurosteroid-based reagents photolabeled two sites per GLIC subunit, both within the transmembrane domain; one site was an intrasubunit site, and the other was located in the interface between subunits. By using reagents with photoreactive groups positioned throughout the neurosteroid backbone, we precisely map the orientation of neurosteroid binding within each site. Amino acid substitutions introduced at either site altered neurosteroid modulation of GLIC channel activity, demonstrating the functional role of both sites. These results provide a detailed molecular model of multisite neurosteroid modulation of GLIC, which may be applicable to other mammalian pLGICs.","Cheng Wayland W L, Chen Zi-Wei, Bracamontes John R, Budelier Melissa M, Krishnan Kathiresan, Shin Daniel J, Wang Cunde, Jiang Xin, Covey Douglas F, Akk Gustav, Evers Alex S",The Journal of biological chemistry,2018,29301936,PMC5827446,10.1074/jbc.RA117.000359,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29301936,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5827446,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Nurses' Reflections on Benefits and Challenges of Implementing Family-Centered Care in Pediatric Intensive Care Units.,"Family-centered care is a proposed way of supporting family involvement with a child's care and decreasing distress associated with a child's critical illness by improving communication, helping manage stress and coping, and decreasing conflicts. Nurses are critical to successful implementation of family-centered care. To describe nurses' perceptions of the benefits and challenges of providing family-centered care in pediatric intensive care units. Semistructured interviews of 10 bedside and charge nurses in pediatric, cardiac, and neonatal intensive care units. Questions were related to 4 domains: the intensive care unit environment and its relationship to the structure and delivery of critical care, stressors for nurses and families, communication challenges and strategies, and involvement of families in care and decision-making. The main thematic finding was the nurses' descriptions of a ""balancing act"" to provide quality family-centered care. The balancing act was characterized by the interaction between 2 types of changes: (1) intensive care unit policies related to visitation hours and family presence at the bedside and (2) physical transformations in the intensive care unit from shared open space to individual private rooms. All of the nurses viewed the transition to family-centered care as having benefits for families. They also described how changes had created new challenges for the delivery of nursing care in intensive care units, particularly regarding mentorship and the safety of patients and staff.","Coats Heather, Bourget Erica, Starks Helene, Lindhorst Taryn, Saiki-Craighill Shigeko, Curtis J Randall, Hays Ross, Doorenbos Ardith","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",2018,29292276,PMC5959722,10.4037/ajcc2018353,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29292276,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959722,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
In vivo imaging of human oral hard and soft tissues by polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography.,"Since optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides three-dimensional high-resolution images of biological tissue, the benefit of polarization contrast in the field of dentistry is highlighted in this study. Polarization-sensitive OCT (PS OCT) with phase-sensitive recording is used for imaging dental and mucosal tissues in the human oral cavity in vivo. An enhanced polarization contrast of oral structures is reached by analyzing the signals of the co- and crosspolarized channels of the swept source PS OCT system quantitatively with respect to reflectivity, retardation, optic axis orientation, and depolarization. The calculation of these polarization parameters enables a high tissue-specific contrast imaging for the detailed physical interpretation of human oral hard and soft tissues. For the proof-of-principle, imaging of composite restorations and mineralization defects at premolars as well as gingival, lingual, and labial oral mucosa was performed in vivo within the anterior oral cavity.

Nitrous oxide added at the end of isoflurane anesthesia hastens early recovery without increasing the risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting: a randomized clinical trial.,"Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has been reported to increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated the effect of adding N<sub>2</sub>O at the end of isoflurane inhalational anesthesia on the recovery and incidence of PONV. Our hypothesis was that N<sub>2</sub>O would reduce the time to early recovery without increasing the incidence of PONV. After obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 100 women at American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III and scheduled for laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy were randomized into two groups (G) according to the carrier gas: GO<sub>2</sub> (air in 30% oxygen) and GN<sub>2</sub>O (the same mixture until the last 30 min of surgery, when 70% N<sub>2</sub>O in 30% oxygen was used). No PONV prophylaxis was given. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, vecuronium 0.1 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, and fentanyl 1-2 μg·kg<sup>-1</sup> iv and maintained with isoflurane. Indicators of early recovery (time to extubation, eye opening, following commands, orientation) were assessed by an anesthesiologist unaware of the group assignment. The incidence and severity of PONV was measured at two and 24 hr postoperatively. Altogether, 82 participants completed the study (42 in GO<sub>2</sub>, 40 in GN<sub>2</sub>O) and were analyzed. The mean (SD) time of N<sub>2</sub>O administration in GN<sub>2</sub>O patients was 27.1 (10.1) min. The mean (SD) time to extubation was faster in GN<sub>2</sub>O patients [5.4 (2.9) min] than in GO<sub>2</sub> patients [7.5 (3.7) min] (mean difference, 2.0 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 3.4, P = 0.009).

Real-time endoscopic image orientation correction system using an accelerometer and gyrosensor.,"The discrepancy between spatial orientations of an endoscopic image and a physician's working environment can make it difficult to interpret endoscopic images. In this study, we developed and evaluated a device that corrects the endoscopic image orientation using an accelerometer and gyrosensor. The acceleration of gravity and angular velocity were retrieved from the accelerometer and gyrosensor attached to the handle of the endoscope. The rotational angle of the endoscope handle was calculated using a Kalman filter with transmission delay compensation. Technical evaluation of the orientation correction system was performed using a camera by comparing the optical rotational angle from the captured image with the rotational angle calculated from the sensor outputs. For the clinical utility test, fifteen anesthesiology residents performed a video endoscopic examination of an airway model with and without using the orientation correction system. The participants reported numbers written on papers placed at the left main, right main, and right upper bronchi of the airway model. The correctness and the total time it took participants to report the numbers were recorded. During the technical evaluation, errors in the calculated rotational angle were less than 5 degrees. In the clinical utility test, there was a significant time reduction when using the orientation correction system compared with not using the system (median, 52 vs. 76 seconds; P = .012). In this study, we developed a real-time endoscopic image orientation correction system, which significantly improved physician performance during a video endoscopic exam.","Lee Hyung-Chul, Jung Chul-Woo, Kim Hee Chan",PloS one,2017,29099845,PMC5669437,10.1371/journal.pone.0186691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099845,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5669437,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Tackling Regional Public Health Issues Using Mobile Health Technology: Event Report of an mHealth Hackathon in Thailand.,"Hackathons are intense, short, collaborative events focusing on solving real world problems through interdisciplinary teams. This is a report of the mHealth hackathon hosted by Khon Kaen University in collaboration with MIT Sana and faculty members from Harvard Medical School with the aim to improve health care delivery in the Northeast region of Thailand. Key health challenges, such as improving population health literacy, tracking disease trajectory and outcomes among rural communities, and supporting the workflow of overburdened frontline providers, were addressed using mHealth. Many modifications from the usual format of hackathon were made to tailor the event to the local context and culture, such as the process of recruiting participants and how teams were matched and formed. These modifications serve as good learning points for hosting future hackathons. There are also many lessons learned about how to achieve a fruitful collaboration despite cultural barriers, how to best provide mentorship to the participants, how to instill in the participants a sense of mission, and how to match the participants in a fair and efficient manner. This event showcases how interdisciplinary collaboration can produce results that are unattainable by any discipline alone and demonstrates that innovations are the fruits of collective wisdom of people from different fields of expertise who work together toward the same goals.","Pathanasethpong Atipong, Soomlek Chitsutha, Morley Katharine, Morley Michael, Polpinit Pattarawit, Dagan Alon, Weis James W, Celi Leo Anthony",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2017,29038098,PMC5662787,10.2196/mhealth.8259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29038098,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662787,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Safe Surgery for All: Early Lessons from Implementing a National Government-Driven Surgical Plan in Ethiopia.,"Recognizing the unmet need for surgical care in Ethiopia, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) has pioneered innovative methodologies for surgical system development with Saving Lives through Safe Surgery (SaLTS). SaLTS is a national flagship initiative designed to improve access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system. Sustained commitment from the FMOH and their recruitment of implementing partners has led to notable accomplishments across the breadth of the surgical system, including but not limited to: (1) Leadership, management and governance-a nationally scaled surgical leadership and mentorship programme, (2) Infrastructure-operating room construction and oxygen delivery plan, (3) Supplies and logistics-a national essential surgical procedure and equipment list, (4) Human resource development-a Surgical Workforce Expansion Plan and Anaesthesia National Roadmap, (5) Advocacy and partnership-strong FMOH partnership with international organizations, including GE Foundation's SafeSurgery2020 initiative, (6) Innovation-facility-driven identification of problems and solutions, (7) Quality of surgical and anaesthesia care service delivery-a national peri-operative guideline and WHO Surgical Safety Checklist implementation, and (8) Monitoring and evaluation-a comprehensive plan for short-term and long-term assessment of surgical quality and capacity. As Ethiopia progresses with its commitment to prioritize surgery within its Health Sector Transformation Plan, disseminating the process and outcomes of the SaLTS initiative will inform other countries on successful national implementation strategies. The following article describes the process by which the Ethiopian FMOH established surgical system reform and the preliminary results of implementation across these eight pillars.","Burssa Daniel, Teshome Atlibachew, Iverson Katherine, Ahearn Olivia, Ashengo Tigistu, Barash David, Barringer Erin, Citron Isabelle, Garringer Kaya, McKitrick Victoria, Meara John, Mengistu Abraham, Mukhopadhyay Swagoto, Reynolds Cheri, Shrime Mark, Varghese Asha, Esseye Samson, Bekele Abebe",World journal of surgery,2017,29030677,,10.1007/s00268-017-4271-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29030677,,TRUE,National surgical leadership and mentorship programme,Surgical and anesthesia providers in Ethiopia,"Improved access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system",TRUE,"Surgical leadership and mentorship programme, Surgical Workforce Expansion Plan and Anaesthesia National Roadmap","Healthcare system in Ethiopia, specifically surgical and anaesthesia care","Improved access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system"
Bispectral Index and non-Bispectral Index anesthetic protocols on postoperative recovery outcomes.,"The study aimed to compare Bispectral Index (BIS) and non-BIS anesthetic protocols on postoperative recovery outcomes. Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until January 21, 2016. Twenty-six studies were included with a total of 9537 patients. BIS monitoring was significantly associated with shorter time to eye opening (P=0.001), time to extubation (P<0.001), and time to orientation (P=0.002) compared with non-BIS monitoring. No difference between groups was seen with respect to hypoxemia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), time to oral fluid intake, and length of Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU) stay (P values ≥0.185). The use of BIS-monitoring is superior to non-BIS monitored anesthesia in terms of shorter time to eye-opening, extubation, and orientation. BIS monitor may be considered a safe and effective method for monitoring depth of anesthesia during surgery.","Chiang Min-Hsien, Wu Shao-Chun, Hsu Shih-Wei, Chin Jo-Chi",Minerva anestesiologica,2018,29027770,,10.23736/S0375-9393.17.12033-X,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29027770,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The relationship between single and two-dimensional indices of left ventricular size using hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiography in trauma and burn patients.,"Conventional echocardiographic technique for assessment of volume status and cardiac contractility utilizes left ventricular end-diastolic area (LVEDA) and fractional area of change (FAC), respectively. Our goal was to find a technically reliable yet faster technique to evaluate volume status and contractility by measuring left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and fractional shortening (FS) in a cohort of mechanically ventilated trauma and burn patients using hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiographic (hTEE) monitoring. Retrospective chart review performed at trauma/burn intensive care unit (TBICU). Data on 88 mechanically ventilated surgical intensive care patients cared for between July 2013 and July 2015 were reviewed. Initial measurements of LVEDA, left ventricular end-systolic area (LVESA) and FAC were collected. Post-processing left ventricular end-systolic (LVESD) and end-diastolic diameters (LVEDD) were measured and fractional shortening (FS) was calculated. Two orthogonal measurements of LV diameter were obtained in transverse (Tr) and posteroanterior (PA) orientation. There was a significant correlation between transverse and posteroanterior left ventricular diameter measurements in both systole and diastole. In systole, r = 0.92, p < 0.01 for LVESD-Tr (mean 23.47 mm, SD ± 6.77) and LVESD-PA (mean 24.84 mm, SD = 8.23). In diastole, r = 0.80, p < 0.01 for LVEDD-Tr (mean 37.60 mm, SD ± 6.45), and LVEDD-PA diameters (mean 42.24 mm, SD ± 7.97). Left ventricular area (LVEDA) also significantly correlated with left ventricular diameter LVEDD-Tr (r = 0.84, p < 0.01) and LVEDD-PA (r = 0.90, p < 0.01). Both transverse and PA measurements of fractional shortening were significantly (p < 0.0001) and similarly correlated with systolic function as measured by FAC. Bland-Altman analyses also indicated that the assessment of fractional shortening using left ventricular posteroanterior diameter measurement shows agreement with FAC. Left ventricular diameter measurements are a reliable and technically feasible alternative to left ventricular area measurements in the assessment of cardiac filling and systolic function.","Younan Duraid, Beasley T Mark, Pigott David C, Gibson C Blayke, Gullett John P, Richey Jeffrey, Pittet Jean-Francois, Zaky Ahmed",Critical ultrasound journal,2017,29022204,PMC5636773,10.1186/s13089-017-0074-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29022204,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5636773,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Impact of Empathy in the Patient-Doctor Relationship on Chronic Pain Relief and Quality of Life: A Prospective Study in Spanish Pain Clinics.,"To assess the impact of the empathy of physicians, perceived by patients with chronic pain, regarding pain relief and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). A prospective noninterventional study was conducted in 2,898 patients with moderate to severe chronic pain who were referred to pain clinics. The same physician visited each patient at baseline and after one and three months. Study questionnaires included the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE), the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), the Pain Coping Questionnaire (CAD-R), the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF), and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D). Regression analyses were used to evaluate the independent contribution of the changes in perceived empathy over pain intensity and improvement of HR-QoL. BPI-SF scores for pain intensity, rated as worst, least, average, and current pain, decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline to month 3, with reductions of 33.7%, 42.5%, 40.0%, and 46.9%, respectively. Pain intensity decreased from 6.3 ± 1.5 at baseline to 4.7 ± 1.8 at one month and 3.8 ± 1.9 at three months (P < 0.050). Significant (P < 0.001) improvements in the EQ-5D tariff (+37.1%) and EQ-5D VAS (+26.7%) were also recorded. In the linear regression analysis, JSPPPE and LOT-R, but not CAD-R, were significantly associated with pain relief and HR-QoL. Physicians' empathy and patients' dispositional optimism have a role in determining positive outcomes in patients with chronic pain. Physicians' empathy may therefore be a suitable, yet relatively unexplored, target for intervention.","Cánovas Luz, Carrascosa Antonio-José, García Modesto, Fernández Mariano, Calvo Almudena, Monsalve Vicente, Soriano José-Francisco","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2018,29016846,,10.1093/pm/pnx160,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29016846,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Electron Microscopy of Dural and Arachnoid Disruptions After Subarachnoid Block.,"It has been customary to attribute postdural puncture headache (PDPH) incidence and severity to size and nature of the dural hole produced during major neuraxial blockade or diagnostic dural puncture. Needle orientation in relation to the direction of dural fibers was thought to be of importance because of the propensity for horizontal bevel placement to cause cutting rather than splitting of the dural fibers. In vitro punctures of stringently quality-controlled human dural sac specimens were obtained with 27-gauge (27G) Whitacre needle (n = 33), with 29G Quincke used parallel to the spinal axis (n = 30), and with 29G Quincke in perpendicular approach (n = 40). The samples were studied with a scanning electron microscope, and the perimeter, appearance, and area (%) of the lesion were calculated. When using small 27G to 29G needles, neither needle tip characteristics nor needle orientation had a substantial bearing on the damage to dural fibers in the dural lesion. Of ultimate importance was the characteristic and size of the hole in the arachnoid. Arachnoid layer lesions produced by different types of spinal needles were not markedly different. Accepted theories of the etiology of PDPH need to be revised. This article marks the first time that arachnoid layer damage has been quantified. Dural fibers tend to have sufficient ""memory"" to close back the hole created by a spinal needle, whereas arachnoid has diminished capacity to do so. The pathogenesis of PDPH and its resolution algorithm are a far more complex process that involves many more ""stages"" of development than hitherto imagined.","Reina Miguel Angel, Puigdellívol-Sánchez Anna, Gatt Stephen P, De Andrés José, Prats-Galino Alberto, van Zundert André",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,2017,28991062,,10.1097/AAP.0000000000000667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28991062,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Variations in assessment and certification in postgraduate anaesthesia training: a European survey.,"Postgraduate specialty training has traditionally been based on a time- and rotation-based model, but competency-based models are emerging. Because anaesthesia training evolves differently across Europe, variations in assessment and certification processes are expected, but the extent of similarities and differences is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare anaesthesia training programmes in Europe, focusing on assessment and certification processes. We performed an online survey among national representatives of the Union of European Medical Specialists/European Board of Anaesthesiology. All 36 countries participated. Duration of training had a median of 5 yr (range 2.75-7). Mean number of different assessment tools was 7.45 (range 4-13), with more tools being used in competency-based programmes [mean 9.1 (sd 2.97) vs 7.0 (sd 1.97); P=0.03]. Most countries had a nationally uniform certification process. Based on a qualitative analysis of the survey findings, a categorization of countries emerged, reflecting the approach to assessment and certification. We observed two main streams of countries with an underlying knowledge or procedural focus within a time- and rotation-based apprenticeship model. These main streams are evolving, to different extents, towards a third orientation, competency-based training. Assessment and certification processes in European anaesthesia training are diverse. In many countries, a time-based apprenticeship model is evolving towards a competency-based certification process. This diversity precludes comparison of competence of graduating anaesthetists across Europe.","Jonker G, Manders L A, Marty A P, Kalkman C J, Ten Cate Th J, van Gessel E F, Hoff R G",British journal of anaesthesia,2017,28981584,,10.1093/bja/aex196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28981584,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Osteology and radiology of the Maned Wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) pelvic limb.,"This study describes the osteology and radiology of the pelvic limb in maned wolves. Ten (five live and five dead) maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus), five males and five females, aged from 2 to 7 years old were used. Digital radiographs were taken and recorded for both pelvic limbs in all animals. Osteology was correlated with the radiographic images. The pelvis had a rectangular shape, and the obturator foramen (foramen obturatum) was oval. The femoral neck (collum femoris) was short and thick. The greater trochanter (trochanter major) extended proximally to near the dorsum of the femoral head (caput ossis femoris). The lateral femoral condyle (condylus lateralis) was larger than the medial condyle (condylus medialis), and the intercondylar fossa (fossa intercondylaris) had a slightly oblique orientation. The proximal tibia displayed medial and lateral condyles with the medial larger. The femur was slightly shorter than the tibia. Seven tarsal bones (ossa tarsi) were present, four long metatarsal bones (ossa metatarsalia II - V) and a short first metatarsal bone (os metatarsal I).","Siqueira R C, Rahal S C, Inamassu L R, Mamprim M J, Felix M, Castilho M S, Mesquita L R, Ribeiro V L, Teixeira C R, Rassy F B","Anatomia, histologia, embryologia",2017,28940671,,10.1111/ahe.12314,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28940671,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Encouraging Reflexivity in a Residency Leadership Development Program: Expanding Outside the Competency Approach.,"While leadership development is increasingly a goal of academic medicine, it is typically framed as competency acquisition, which can limit its focus to a circumscribed set of social behaviors. This orientation may also reinforce the cultural characteristics of academic medicine that can make effective leadership difficult, rather than training leaders capable of examining and changing this culture. Expanding leadership development so it promotes social reflexivity presents a way to bolster some of the weaknesses of the competency paradigm. In 2013-2016, the University of Penn sylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care (DACC) carried out a leadership development program for residents, which included seminars focused on developing particular leadership skills and annual capstone sessions facilitating discussion between residents and attending physicians about topics chosen by residents. The capstone sessions proved to be most impactful, serving as forums for open conversation about how these groups interact when engaged in social behaviors such as giving/receiving feedback, offering support after an adverse event, and teaching/learning in the clinic. The success of the capstone sessions led to a 2016 DACC-wide initiative to facilitate transparency among all professional roles (faculty, residents, nurse anesthetists, administrative staff) and encourage widespread reflexive examination about how the manner in which these groups interact encourages or impedes leadership and teamwork. Further work is necessary to describe how leadership program formats can be diversified to better encourage reflexivity. There is also a need to develop mechanisms for assessing outcomes of leadership programs that expand outside the competency-based system.","Clapp Justin T, Gordon Emily K B, Baranov Dimitry Y, Trey Beulah, Tilin Felice J, Fleisher Lee A",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2018,28930765,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000001915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28930765,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A coarse-grained computational model of the nuclear pore complex predicts Phe-Gly nucleoporin dynamics.,"The phenylalanine-glycine-repeat nucleoporins (FG-Nups), which occupy the lumen of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), are critical for transport between the nucleus and cytosol. Although NPCs differ in composition across species, they are largely conserved in organization and function. Transport through the pore is on the millisecond timescale. Here, to explore the dynamics of nucleoporins on this timescale, we use coarse-grained computational simulations. These simulations generate predictions that can be experimentally tested to distinguish between proposed mechanisms of transport. Our model reflects the conserved structure of the NPC, in which FG-Nup filaments extend into the lumen and anchor along the interior of the channel. The lengths of the filaments in our model are based on the known characteristics of yeast FG-Nups. The FG-repeat sites also bind to each other, and we vary this association over several orders of magnitude and run 100-ms simulations for each value. The autocorrelation functions of the orientation of the simulated FG-Nups are compared with in vivo anisotropy data. We observe that FG-Nups reptate back and forth through the NPC at timescales commensurate with experimental measurements of the speed of cargo transport through the NPC. Our results are consistent with models of transport where FG-Nup filaments are free to move across the central channel of the NPC, possibly informing how cargo might transverse the NPC.","Pulupa Joan, Rachh Manas, Tomasini Michael D, Mincer Joshua S, Simon Sanford M",The Journal of general physiology,2017,28887410,PMC5694938,10.1085/jgp.201711769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28887410,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5694938,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Career Development Guidance and Mentorship during Anesthesia Residency Training: An Internet Survey.,"We conducted a survey of Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States to identify current practice regarding mentorship and teaching of topics related to career development. Program directors for all currently accredited Anesthesiology residency programs (N=129 as of April 2016) were contacted by e-mail and invited to complete a short internet survey. Two follow-up e-mails were sent at one-week intervals to those who had not yet responded. 59 program directors responded, yielding 53 complete responses, for an adjusted response rate of 41.1%. Program and practice management type (university versus other, hospital versus private) were not strongly associated with presence of a career development curriculum (CDC). In general, larger residency programs (30 or more residents) and university-based programs were more likely to provide lectures on specific CDC topics. Whether residency program directors agreed or disagreed with the premise that instruction should be provided on other topics besides anesthesia, was unrelated to the presence of CDC in their programs. The results of this survey demonstrate that the establishment of a mentorship program (even a rudimentary one) may be the first step in creating a CDC. Apart from having a CDC program already in place, the strongest predictor of CDC content was the size of the residency program. Though there are training programs that openly stated on our survey that they do not have a CDC in place, some of these programs still provided lectures on one or more of the topics surveyed.","Gupta Ruchir, Reinsel Ruth",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2017,28884135,PMC5581964,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28884135,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5581964,TRUE,Mentorship programs and career development curriculum (CDC) for anesthesiology residents,Anesthesiology residents in United States training programs,Better career development guidance and preparation for anesthesiology practice,TRUE,Establishment of a mentorship program and career development curriculum,Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States,"Provision of lectures on specific career development topics, especially in larger and university-based programs"
Honey Mitigates Radiation-Induced Oral Mucositis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients without Affecting the Tumor Response.,"Radiation-induced mucositis is a dose-limiting factor in the effective treatment of head and neck (H & N) cancers. The objective of this study was to understand the efficacy of honey in mitigating radiation-induced mucositis and whether it would interfere with tumor control. This was a single-blinded, randomized, controlled study and was carried out in patients with H &amp; N cancer requiring curative radiotherapy (>62 Gy (Gray)). The patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive either honey ( <i>n</i> = 25) or povidone-iodine (active comparator) ( <i>n</i> = 25) during radiotherapy. Oral mucositis was assessed using the RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) grading system before the start, during, and at the end of the treatment by an investigator unaware of the treatment. The results indicate that when compared with the active comparator, honey reduced the radiation-induced oral mucositis, decreased the incidence of intolerable mucositis, treatment breaks, loss of treatment days ( <i>p</i> < 0.0001 and < 0.0003) and did not affect the radiation-induced tumor response. The clinical observations indicate that honey mitigates the radiation-induced mucositis and does not interfere with tumor cell killing.","Rao Suresh, Hegde Sanath K, Rao Pratima, Dinkar Chetana, Thilakchand Karadka R, George Thomas, Baliga-Rao Manjeshwar P, Palatty Princy L, Baliga Manjeshwar S","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2017,28878156,PMC5615289,10.3390/foods6090077,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878156,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5615289,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Women awaken faster than men after electroencephalogram-monitored propofol sedation for colonoscopy: A prospective observational study.,"Sedation for colonoscopy using intravenous propofol has become standard in many Western countries. Gender-specific differences have been shown for general anaesthesia in dentistry, but no such data existed for gastrointestinal endoscopy. A prospective observational study. An academic teaching hospital of Hannover Medical School. A total of 219 patients (108 women and 111 men) scheduled for colonoscopy. Propofol sedation using electroencephalogram monitoring during a constant level of sedation depth (D0 to D2) performed by trained nurses or physicians after a body-weight-adjusted loading dose. The primary end-point was the presence of gender-specific differences in awakening time (time from end of sedation to eye-opening and complete orientation); secondary outcome parameters analysed were total dose of propofol, sedation-associated complications (bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxaemia and apnoea), patient cooperation and patient satisfaction. Multivariate analysis was performed to correct confounding factors such as age and BMI. Women awakened significantly faster than men, with a time to eye-opening of 7.3 ± 3.7 versus 8.4 ± 3.4 min (P = 0.005) and time until complete orientation of 9.1 ± 3.9 versus 10.4 ± 13.7 min (P = 0.008).

Effectiveness of two distinct web-based education tools for bedside nurses on medication administration practice for venous thromboembolism prevention: A randomized clinical trial.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of preventable harm in hospitalized patients. While numerous successful interventions have been implemented to improve prescription of VTE prophylaxis, a substantial proportion of doses of prescribed preventive medications are not administered to hospitalized patients. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of nurse education on medication administration practice. This was a double-blinded, cluster randomized trial in 21 medical or surgical floors of 933 nurses at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, an academic medical center, from April 1, 2014 -March 31, 2015. Nurses were cluster-randomized by hospital floor to receive either a linear static education (Static) module with voiceover or an interactive learner-centric dynamic scenario-based education (Dynamic) module. The primary and secondary outcomes were non-administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis medication and nurse-reported satisfaction with education modules, respectively. Overall, non-administration improved significantly following education (12.4% vs. 11.1%, conditional OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95, p = 0.002) achieving our primary objective. The reduction in non-administration was greater for those randomized to the Dynamic arm (10.8% vs. 9.2%, conditional OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.95) versus the Static arm (14.5% vs. 13.5%, conditional OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81-1.03), although the difference between arms was not statistically significant (p = 0.26). Satisfaction scores were significantly higher (p<0.05) for all survey items for nurses in the Dynamic arm. Education for nurses significantly improves medication administration practice. Dynamic learner-centered education is more effective at engaging nurses. These findings suggest that education should be tailored to the learner.

Diagnostic precision of triage algorithms for mass casualty incidents. English version.,"Regarding survival and quality of life recent mass casualty incidents again emphasize the importance of early identification of the correct degree of injury/illness to enable prioritization of treatment amongst patients and their transportation to an appropriate hospital. The present study investigated existing triage algorithms in terms of sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) as well as its process duration in a relevant emergency patient cohort. In this study 500 consecutive air rescue missions were evaluated by means of standardized patient records. Classification of patients was accomplished by 19 emergency physicians. Every case was independently classified by at least 3 physicians without considering any triage algorithm. Existing triage algorithms Primary Ranking for Initial Orientation in Emergency Medical Services (PRIOR), modified Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (mSTaRT), Field Triage Score (FTS), Amberg-Schwandorf Algorithm for Triage (ASAV), Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (STaRT), Care Flight, and Triage Sieve were additionally carried out computer based on each case, to enable calculation of quality criteria. The analyzed cohort had an age of (mean ± SD) 59 ± 25 years, a NACA score of 3.5 ± 1.1 and consisted of 57% men. On arrival 8 patients were deceased. Consequently, 492 patients were included in the analysis. The distribution of triage categories T1/T2/T3 were 10%/47%/43%, respectively. The highest diagnostic quality was achieved with START, mSTaRT, and ASAV yielding a SE of 78% and a SP ranging from 80-83%. The subgroup of surgical patients reached a SE of 95% and a SP between 85-91%. The newly established algorithm PRIOR exerted a SE of 90% but merely a SP of 54% in the overall cohort thereby consuming the longest time for overall decision. Triage procedures with acceptable diagnostic quality exist to identify the most severely injured. Due to its high rate of false positive results (over-triage) the recently developed PRIOR algorithm will cause overload of available resources for the severely injured within mass casualty incident missions. Non-surgical patients still are poorly identified by the available algorithms.","Heller A R, Salvador N, Frank M, Schiffner J, Kipke R, Kleber C",Der Anaesthesist,2019,28798972,,10.1007/s00101-017-0352-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28798972,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Development and Implementation of a School-Wide Institute for Excellence in Education to Enable Educational Scholarship by Medical School Faculty.,"Educational scholarship is an important component for faculty at Academic Medical Centers, especially those with single-track promotion systems. Yet, faculty may lack the skills and mentorship needed to successfully complete projects. In addition, many educators feel undervalued. To reinvigorate our school's educational mission, the Institute for Excellence in Education (IEE) was created. Here we focus on one of the IEE's strategic goals, that of inspiring and supporting educational research, scholarship, and innovation. Using the 6-step curriculum development process as a framework, we describe the development and outcomes of IEE programs aimed at enabling educational scholarship at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Four significant programs that focused on educational scholarship were developed and implemented: (a) an annual conference, (b) a Faculty Education Scholars' Program, (c) ""Shark Tank"" small-grant program, and (d) Residency Redesign Challenge grants. A diverse group of primarily junior faculty engaged in these programs with strong mentorship, successfully completing and disseminating projects. Faculty members have been able to clarify their personal goals and develop a greater sense of self-efficacy for their desired paths in teaching and educational research. Faculty require programs and resources for educational scholarship and career development, focused on skills building in methodology, assessment, and statistical analysis. Mentoring and the time to work on projects are critical. Key to the IEE's success in maintaining and building programs has been ongoing needs assessment of faculty and learners and a strong partnership with our school's fund-raising staff. The IEE will next try to expand opportunities by adding additional mentoring capacity and further devilment of our small-grants programs.","Cofrancesco Joseph, Barone Michael A, Serwint Janet R, Goldstein Mitchell, Westman Michael, Lipsett Pamela A",Teaching and learning in medicine,2018,28753084,,10.1080/10401334.2017.1325741,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28753084,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Delayed Recall and Working Memory MMSE Domains Predict Delirium following Cardiac Surgery.,"Reduced preoperative cognition is a risk factor for postoperative delirium. The significance for type of preoperative cognitive deficit, however, has yet to be explored and could provide important insights into mechanisms and prediction of delirium. Our goal was to determine if certain cognitive domains from the general cognitive screener, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), predict delirium after cardiac surgery. Patients completed a preoperative MMSE prior to undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Following surgery, delirium was assessed throughout ICU stay using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU delirium and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale. Cardiac surgery patients who developed delirium (n = 137) had lower total MMSE scores than patients who did not develop delirium (n = 457). In particular, orientation to place, working memory, delayed recall, and language domain scores were lower. Of these, only the working memory and delayed recall domains predicted delirium in a regression model adjusting for history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, age, sex, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. For each word not recalled on the three-word delayed recall assessment, the odds of delirium increased by 50%. For each item missed on the working memory index, the odds of delirium increased by 36%. Of the patients who developed delirium, 47% had a primary impairment in memory, 21% in working memory, and 33% in both domains. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve using only the working memory and delayed recall domains was 0.75, compared to 0.76 for total MMSE score.

"The Graduate Medical Education Scholars Track: Developing Residents as Clinician-Educators During Clinical Training via a Longitudinal, Multimodal, and Multidisciplinary Track.","Residency clinician-educator tracks have been created; however, they have generally been limited to a single discipline or program and experienced some challenges. The Graduate Medical Education Scholars Track (GMEST), an embedded longitudinal, multimodal, multidisciplinary clinician-educator track for residents, was piloted at the Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, in academic year 2014-2015. The GMEST is a two-year experience completed during residency training. The goal is to prepare trainees for academic careers as clinician-educators with a focus on medical education scholarship. This track is designed for residents from diverse training programs with variable clinical schedules and blends a live interactive program, asynchronous instruction and discussion, and overarching multimodal mentorship in medical education. Participants are expected to complete a capstone medical education project and submit it to institutional, regional, and/or national venues. Data gathered from the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 cohorts demonstrated that 21/22 (95%) participants were satisfied with the GMEST curriculum, felt it was important to their development as future clinician-educators, and felt it would positively influence their ability to work in medical education. Further, 18/22 (82%) participants wished to pursue a career as a clinician-educator and in medical education leadership and/or scholarship. The authors will longitudinally track graduates' future career positions, projects, publications, and awards, and cross-match and compare GMEST graduates with non-GMEST residents interested in medical education. Faculty mentors, program directors, and the Medical Education, Research, Innovation, Teaching, and Scholarship community will be asked for feedback on the GMEST.","Ahn James, Martin Shannon K, Farnan Jeanne M, Fromme H Barrett",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2018,28678096,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000001815,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28678096,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Assuring Sustainable Gains in Interdisciplinary Performance Improvement: Creating a Shared Mental Model During Operating Room to Cardiac ICU Handoff.,"To understand sustainability and assure long-term gains in multidisciplinary performance improvement using an operating room to cardiac ICU handoff process focused on creation of a shared mental model. Performance improvement cohort project with pre- and postintervention assessments spanning a 4-year period. Twenty-six bed pediatric cardiac ICU in a tertiary care children's hospital. Cardiac surgery patients admitted to cardiac ICU from the operating room following cardiac surgery. An interdisciplinary workgroup overhauled our handoff process in 2010. The new algorithm emphasized role delineation, standardized communication, and creation of a shared mental model. Our ""I-5"" mnemonic allowed validation and verification of a shared mental model between multidisciplinary teams. Staff orientation and practice guidelines were revised to incorporate the new process, visual aids were distributed and posted at each patient's bedside, and lapses/audit data were discussed in multidisciplinary forum. Audits assessing equipment and information transfer during handoff were performed 8 weeks following implementation (n = 29), repeated at 1 year (n = 37), 3 years (n = 15), and 4 years (n = 50). Staff surveys prior to implementation, at 8 weeks, and 4 years postintervention assessed satisfaction. Comprehensiveness of information transfer improved in the 4 years following implementation, and staff satisfaction was maintained. At 4 years, discussion of all elements of information transfer was 94%, increased from 85% 8 weeks following implementation and discussion of four or more information elements was 100% increased from 93%.

Junior faculty core curriculum to enhance faculty development.,"Senior Instructors and Assistant Professors in their first academic appointment may not have all the tools for an efficient start to their careers. Although many institutions provide access to mentoring programs and seminars on faculty development, the timing and format of the offerings often conflict with ongoing responsibilities of the faculty, particularly clinical faculty. We established a collaboration between the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and the University of Rochester Medical Center Office for Faculty Development with the goal of developing a week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum that would better suit faculty schedules. We convened focus groups and with their help, identified themes for inclusion in the course. Speakers were identified from among local senior faculty. University leadership was enlisted in promoting the course. Individual speakers and course content were evaluated daily, at the end of the week-long course, and 6 months later. Planning for subsequent years incorporated the feedback. Yearly evaluations and subsequent course modification continued. Junior faculty from nearly every department in the Medical Center were represented. There was high learner satisfaction and participation however several limitations were identified and addressed in subsequent years. The focus on principles and available resources, not specific skills or content was appropriate. Daily interactions among participants from a wide variety of departments fostered networking among faculty who may not otherwise have met and discussed common interests. The ultimate value of such an early, intensive faculty development program will depend on whether it equips junior faculty to organize, develop, and achieve their academic goals better than alternative formats. This will require further study.","Guillet Ronnie, Holloway Robert G, Gross Robert A, Libby Katie, Shapiro Janine R",Journal of clinical and translational science,2017,28649448,PMC5471817,10.1017/cts.2016.29,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28649448,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5471817,TRUE,Week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum focusing on principles and available resources rather than specific skills,Junior faculty (Senior Instructors and Assistant Professors) in their first academic appointment,"Better equipping junior faculty to organize, develop, and achieve academic goals, and fostering networking among faculty from different departments",TRUE,"A week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum that suits faculty schedules, with focus on principles and available resources, not specific skills or content.

China's growing contribution to sepsis research from 1984 to 2014: A bibliometric study.,"The aim of this study was to analyze the global trends of sepsis research and investigate China's contribution by comparing the quantity and quality of sepsis-related publications. Sepsis-related publications were main retrieved from the Web of Science online database by using the keywords ""sepsis"" or ""septic shock."" Bibliometric indicators, including the number of publications, total citation frequency, citation frequency per paper, h-index, research type, orientation, organization, author, journal, and funding support were analyzed. From 1984 to 2014, a total of 70,564 papers regarding sepsis research were published worldwide. 3.60% of which were contributed by authors from Chinese institutions. Although this contribution was less than the Unites States, Germany, England, France or Japan, a notable trend of increase in a number of scientific publications (r  =  0.57, P < .001), with an average annual growth rate of 20.78%, was observed. The quality of the publications was relatively low in China. Basic research was a clear dominant representation, accounting for 50.46% of China's sepsis research. The research centers in China were mainly located in Beijing (5 centers), Shanghai (4 centers), and Hong Kong (3 centers). The National Natural Science Foundation of China supported the most Chinese sepsis researches. Global sepsis research developed swiftly during the 1984 to 2014 period. The USA was in the forefront of sepsis research. Although the data indicated that China had a large increasing rate of publications, there was a considerable gap in the quality of articles between China and other developed countries.","Zhang Kai, Zhao Jialian, Chu Lihua, Jin Yue, Cheng Baoli, Xie Guohao, Wang Yan, Fang Xiangming",Medicine,2017,28640137,PMC5484245,10.1097/MD.0000000000007275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28640137,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5484245,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Techniques for Single-Molecule mRNA Imaging in Living Cells.,"Typical measurement of macromolecules in a biological sample typically averages the result over all the cells or molecules within the sample, and while these types of measurements provide very useful information, they completely miss heterogeneity among the components within the sample that could be a very important aspect of the sample's function. These techniques are also limited in their ability to examine intracellular spatial orientation of molecular activity, which is often a critical component to the regulation of biological processes, particularly in cells with unique spatial relationships, such as neurons. This makes a strong case for single-cell and single-molecule analysis that allows similar novel insight into complex molecular machinery that would not be possible when pooling heterogeneous molecular states. mRNA has proven to be quite tractable to molecular analysis in single cells. Almost two decades of single-molecule studies of mRNA processing both in situ and in live cells have been facilitated by microscopy of mRNA. This has been made possible by multiplexing fluorophores in situ hybridization probes or fluorescent RNA-tag-binding protein probes. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the approaches that have made single-molecule mRNA imaging accessible, as well as to give an overview of the state of the art for techniques that are available to track mRNA in real time in living cells, highlighting the application to neuroscience.",Czaplinski Kevin,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2017,28523559,,10.1007/978-3-319-53889-1_22,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28523559,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Desflurane for ambulatory anaesthesia: A comparison with sevoflurane for recovery profile and airway responses.,"Desflurane and sevoflurane have low blood gas solubility co-efficients, allowing a rapid awakening from anaesthesia. However, desfluraneis pungent and may cause airway irritability. We compared desflurane and sevoflurane with respect to recovery and occurrence of adverse airway responses in spontaneously breathing patients while using the ProSeal™ laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Ninety-four adult patients undergoing hysteroscopic procedures were divided into sevoflurane (S) group or desflurane (D) group. Patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and fentanyl 1μg/kg. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2.0-2.5 mg/kg, followed by insertion of a ProSeal™ LMA. Adverse airway responses such as cough, hiccups, laryngospasm and breathholding were recorded. In the post-operative period: time to awakening, response to verbal commands, orientation, ability to sit with support and the recovery room Aldrete score were recorded. Three patients in group S (6.4%) and six patients (13.3%) in Group D had adverse airway events. The mean time to eye opening (Group S-10.75 ± 7.54 min, Group D-4.94 ± 1.74 min), obeying verbal commands (Group S-13.13 ± 8.75 min, Group D-6.55 ± 1.75 min), orientation (Group S-15.42 ± 8.46 min, Group D-6.23 ± 2.4 min) and to sit with support (Group S-36.09 ± 12.68 min, Group D-14.35 ± 3.75 min) were found to be lesser with desflurane than with sevoflurane (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The mean time to recovery was delayed in Group S-46.00 ± 12.86 min compared to Group D-26.44 ± 5.33 min (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Desflurane has faster awakening properties than sevoflurane without an increase in adverse airway events when used during spontaneous ventilation through a ProSeal™ LMA along with propofol and fentanyl.","Dalal Kajal Sachin, Choudhary Meghana Vijay, Palsania Adit Jagdish, Toal Pratibha Vinayak",Indian journal of anaesthesia,2017,28515519,PMC5416721,10.4103/ija.IJA_513_16,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28515519,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5416721,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"An Etomidate Analogue With Less Adrenocortical Suppression, Stable Hemodynamics, and Improved Behavioral Recovery in Rats.","ET-26 hydrochloride (ET-26HCl) is a novel etomidate analogue designed to alleviate the adrenocortical suppression caused by etomidate while retaining the rapid sedative-hypnotic onset and stable hemodynamic features of etomidate. This study compared the anesthetic effect, hemodynamic stability, and recovery profiles of ET-26HCl, etomidate, and the sedative-hypnotic drug propofol in rats. The metabolic half-life of ET-26HCl was determined in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography analysis of samples of rat plasma and liver homogenates taken from 3 animals. Hypnotic median effective doses (HD50) of ET-26HCl, etomidate, and propofol were determined by up-and-down methods. Anesthesia effect and mean arterial pressure were estimated using equivalent intravenous (IV) doses of propofol, etomidate, and ET-26HCl in the rats. Serum concentrations of corticosterone were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ability of rats to recover from the sedative-hypnotic effects of the drugs was evaluated using open field and Morris water maze tests at equipotent doses of propofol, etomidate, ET-26HCl, and normal saline. The metabolic half-life of ET-26HCl was 81 ± 6 minutes in rat plasma and 126 ± 12 minutes in incubation liver homogenate (mean ± standard deviation), respectively. In vivo experiments showed that the potency of ET-26HCl to cause a loss of righting reflex in rats was 3 times lower than that of etomidate in the rats. IV propofol caused a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure relative to the baseline (-27.9 mm Hg) than did ET-26HCl (-10.7 mm Hg) and etomidate (-19.4 mm Hg) at equipotent doses. Serum corticosterone levels after drug administration were significantly higher in the ET-26HCl group than in the etomidate group at equivalent doses when measured 15 (P < .001), 30 (P < .001), and 60 (P = .002) minutes after stimulation with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH1-24). Recovery of spatial orientation from anesthesia induced by an IV bolus injection was faster with ET-26HCl than with propofol, but recovery of spontaneous activity was slower. ET-26HCl has anesthetic potency and hemodynamic stability similar to etomidate, but it caused less adrenocortical hormone synthesis suppression than etomidate and faster spatial orientation recovery from anesthesia than propofol, which was similar to etomidate.","Wang Bin, Yang Jun, Chen Jun, Kang Yi, Yang Ling-Hui, Liu Jin, Zhang Wen-Sheng",Anesthesia and analgesia,2017,28514325,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000002063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28514325,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Vendor effects on murine gut microbiota influence experimental abdominal sepsis.,"Experimental animal models are indispensable components of preclinical sepsis research. Reproducible results highly rely on defined and invariant baseline conditions. Our hypothesis was that the murine gut microbiota varies among different distributors of laboratory animals and that these variations influence the phenotype of abdominal sepsis derived from a bacterial inoculum model (intraperitoneal stool injection). Male C57BL/6 mice (8-wk old) purchased from Charles River (CR), Janvier (J), and Harlan (H) were sacrificed, and the bacterial composition of feces was analyzed using CHROMagar orientation medium. Stool was injected intraperitoneally into CR mice, followed by clinical observation and gene expression analysis. Experiments were repeated 16 mo later under the same conditions. Stool analysis revealed profound intervendor differences in bacterial composition, mainly regarding Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus licheniformis. Mice challenged with CR as well as H feces developed significantly higher severity of disease and died within the observation period, whereas stool from J mice did not induce any of these symptoms. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed corresponding results with significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and vascular leakage-related mediators in CR and H injected animals. Sixteen months later, the bacterial fecal composition had significantly shifted. The differences in clinical phenotype of sepsis after intraperitoneal stool injection had vanished. We are the first to demonstrate vendor and time effects on the murine fecal microbiota influencing sepsis models of intraabdominal stool contamination. The intestinal microbiota must be defined and standardized when designing and interpreting past and future studies using murine abdominal sepsis models.","Hilbert Tobias, Steinhagen Folkert, Senzig Sebastian, Cramer Nina, Bekeredjian-Ding Isabelle, Parcina Marijo, Baumgarten Georg, Hoeft Andreas, Frede Stilla, Boehm Olaf, Klaschik Sven",The Journal of surgical research,2017,28501108,,10.1016/j.jss.2016.12.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28501108,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Creating a Global Acute Care Surgery Fellowship to Meet International Need.,"Existing Acute Care Surgery (ACS) fellowships are positioned to develop well-trained surgeons with specific skills to facilitate improvements in care delivery in Global ACS. Many resident and fellowship programs offer clinical electives that expose trainees to operative experiences, exposing trainees to the needs in resource-challenged settings. However, most lack a focus on long-term development and research designed to enhance the country's local skills, capability, and capacity. The Global Acute Care Surgery (Global ACS) fellowship produces a surgeon who focuses on capacity building and systems development across the world. At Vanderbilt University, the current American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-Acute Care Surgery (AAST-ACS) fellowship was adapted to create an academic Global Acute Care Surgery (Global ACS) fellowship. This fellowship specifically enhances fellowship trainee's skills in needs assessment and performing research to facilitate the development and implementation of trauma and acute care surgery systems in low- and middle income countries. This research will foster context-appropriate data, collected and based in low- and middle-income countries, to guide practice and policy. Two fellows have completed the Global ACS fellowship at Vanderbilt University. The fellowship requirements, clinical skills, project development and overall goals are outlined within the article. Challenges, funding, and mentorship must also be addressed to develop a comprehensive fellowship. A sample two-year timeline is provided to complete the fellowship track and meet the defined goals. A structured global acute care surgery fellowship enables fellows to reduce the surgical burden of disease and contribute to surgical systems development at both local and international levels by creating meaningful research and developing sustainable change in LMIC countries.","Merchant Amina I, Walters Camila B, Valenzuela Julie, McQueen Kelly A, May Addison K",Journal of surgical education,2017,28427944,,10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.01.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28427944,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Photoaffinity labeling with cholesterol analogues precisely maps a cholesterol-binding site in voltage-dependent anion channel-1.,"Voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) is a highly regulated β-barrel membrane protein that mediates transport of ions and metabolites between the mitochondria and cytosol of the cell. VDAC1 co-purifies with cholesterol and is functionally regulated by cholesterol, among other endogenous lipids. Molecular modeling studies based on NMR observations have suggested five cholesterol-binding sites in VDAC1, but direct experimental evidence for these sites is lacking. Here, to determine the sites of cholesterol binding, we photolabeled purified mouse VDAC1 (mVDAC1) with photoactivatable cholesterol analogues and analyzed the photolabeled sites with both top-down mass spectrometry (MS), and bottom-up MS paired with a clickable, stable isotope-labeled tag, <i>FLI</i>-tag. Using cholesterol analogues with a diazirine in either the 7 position of the steroid ring (LKM38) or the aliphatic tail (KK174), we mapped a binding pocket in mVDAC1 localized to Thr<sup>83</sup> and Glu<sup>73</sup>, respectively. When Glu<sup>73</sup> was mutated to a glutamine, KK174 no longer photolabeled this residue, but instead labeled the nearby Tyr<sup>62</sup> within this same binding pocket. The combination of analytical strategies employed in this work permits detailed molecular mapping of a cholesterol-binding site in a protein, including an orientation of the sterol within the site. Our work raises the interesting possibility that cholesterol-mediated regulation of VDAC1 may be facilitated through a specific binding site at the functionally important Glu<sup>73</sup> residue.","Budelier Melissa M, Cheng Wayland W L, Bergdoll Lucie, Chen Zi-Wei, Janetka James W, Abramson Jeff, Krishnan Kathiresan, Mydock-McGrane Laurel, Covey Douglas F, Whitelegge Julian P, Evers Alex S",The Journal of biological chemistry,2017,28396346,PMC5454110,10.1074/jbc.M116.773069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28396346,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5454110,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Modafinil enhances alerting-related brain activity in attention networks.,"Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent and has been reported to be effective in improving attention in patients with attentional disturbance. However, neural substrates underlying the modafinil effects on attention are not fully understood. We employed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with the attention network test (ANT) task in healthy adults and examined which networks of attention are mainly affected by modafinil and which neural substrates are responsible for the drug effects. We used a randomized placebo-controlled within-subjects cross-over design. Twenty-three healthy adults participated in two series of an fMRI study, taking either a placebo or modafinil. The participants performed the ANT task, which is designed to measure three distinct attentional networks, alerting, orienting, and executive control, during the fMRI scanning. The effects of modafinil on behavioral performance and regional brain activity were analyzed. We found that modafinil enhanced alerting performance and showed greater alerting network activity in the left middle and inferior occipital gyri as compared with the placebo. The brain activations in the occipital regions were positively correlated with alerting performance. Modafinil enhanced alerting performance and increased activation in the occipital lobe in the alerting network possibly relevant to noradrenergic activity during the ANT task. The present study may provide a rationale for the treatment of patients with distinct symptoms of impaired attention.","Ikeda Yumiko, Funayama Takuya, Tateno Amane, Fukayama Haruhisa, Okubo Yoshiro, Suzuki Hidenori",Psychopharmacology,2017,28374089,,10.1007/s00213-017-4614-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28374089,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Preliminary study of a teaching model for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade and effects on the learning curve in veterinary anesthesia residents.,"To evaluate the use of an experimental colloid model for teaching veterinary anesthesia residents ultrasound-guided technique for nerve blockade. Prospective, blinded and randomized. Colloid models were constructed for practice in ultrasound-guided needle location. Nine veterinary anesthesia residents with no prior experience of ultrasound-guided technique for nerve blocks were randomly divided into three groups. Each group received theoretical orientation. Two groups were assigned to practical training using the experimental model: group 1 (G1) received 2 hours of training and group 2 (G2) received 1 hour of training prior to testing with specific tasks. Group 3 (G3) received no practical training. During testing, the time required for task completion (e.g., display of structures and positioning a needle) and the number of failures were recorded. The average times to completion of the tasks and the number of technical failures were: G1, 47 seconds and 1 failure; G2, 68 seconds and 2 failures; G3, 187 seconds and 7 failures. In residents with no prior experience of ultrasound-guided needle placement, using an experimental colloid model and a longer training period was associated with increased accuracy and decreased time to task completion.

Surgical and Teaching Mission to Mongolia: Experience and Lessons.,"For decades, the disparity in medical care across the world along with the fundamental essence of medicine as service has laid the foundation for the global medical mission. Mongolia, a country often overlooked as an area in need of medical aid, harbors a fertile environment for long-term change. In the last 15-20 years, after the fall of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mongolia has turned to a free-market healthcare model and has been struggling with the transition from the formally state-run system. These changes have slowed the original progress noted among surgical specialties, namely neurosurgery, in Mongolia. A lack of resources, a desire for international interaction, and a need for technical mentorship remain a real struggle for local neurosurgeons. Under the auspices of the Virtue Foundation (www.virtuefoundation.org), we report on our 3-year experiences during our surgical and teaching mission to Mongolia and look towards long-term improvements in Mongolian neurosurgery. A total of 15 operations were performed and more than 50 patients seen in clinic during the 3-year experience. Patients ranged from 1 to 77 years of age. No patients encountered any significant peri- or postoperative complications. In our experience with the surgical and teaching mission to Mongolia, when directed appropriately, medical missions can serve as the perfect medium in fostering that environment, providing local healthcare professionals with the knowledge, skills, and motivation to create self-sustaining improvement in their own country, hence promoting intellectual and technological advancement and raising the standard of care.","Haranhalli Neil, Gelfand Yaroslav, Abramowicz Apolonia E, Siyez Abai, Elahi Ebby, Yassari Reza",World neurosurgery,2017,28254543,,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.02.059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28254543,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effect of dezocine combined with propofol on painless gastroscopy in patients with suspect gastric carcinoma.,"To evaluate the effect of dezocine combined with propofol on painless gastroscopy in patients with suspect gastric carcinoma. Forty-three patients with gastric carcinoma who have underwent painless gastroscopy were retrospectively analyzed.

However, the SpO2% was not changed at T1, T2, and T3 in both experiment and control groups (P > 0.05). The RR at T2 was 16.8 ± 2.1 (n/ min) and 14.2 ± 1.8 (n/min) for experiment and control groups, respectively, with statistical difference (P < 0.05). The incidence rate of respiratory depression and body movement was 0.0%, 27.3% for experiment and 23.8%, 47.6% for control group with statistical difference (P < 0.05). The recovery time was 3.6 ± 0.8 min and 1.8 ± 0.6 min for control and experiment group, respectively, which demonstrated experiment group is much shorter than that of control group with statistical difference (P < 0.05). However, nausea and vomiting rate was not statistically different between the experiment and control groups (P > 0.05). Dezocine combined with propofol on painless gastroscopy can reduce the respiratory depression and body movement without interference of hemodynamics.","Ma Ji, Zhang Peng, Zhang Yixuan, Chen Zong, Xin Wenqi, Zhang Donghang, Ma Chuangeng",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,2016,28230034,,10.4103/0973-1482.200755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28230034,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Socio-economic factors, cultural values, national personality and antibiotics use: A cross-cultural study among European countries.","There are considerable cross-national differences in public attitudes towards antibiotics use, use of prescribed antibiotics, and self-medication with antibiotics even within Europe. This study was aimed at investigating the relationships between socio-economic factors, cultural values, national personality characteristics and the antibiotic use in Europe. Data included scores from 27 European countries (14 countries for personality analysis). Correlations between socio-economic variables (Gross National Income per capita, governance quality, life expectancy, mean years of schooling, number of physicians), Hofstede's cultural value dimensions (power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, indulgence), national personality characteristic (extraversion, neuroticism, social desirability) and antibiotic use were calculated and three regression models were constructed. Governance quality (r=-.51), mean years of schooling (r=-.61), power distance (r=.59), masculinity (r=.53), and neuroticism (r=.73) correlated with antibiotic use. The highest amount of variance in antibiotic use was accounted by the cultural values (65%) followed by socio-economic factors (63%) and personality factors (55%). Results show that socio-economic factors, cultural values and national personality characteristics explain cross-national differences in antibiotic use in Europe. In particular, governance quality, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and neuroticism were important factors explaining antibiotics use. The findings underline the importance of socio-economic and cultural context in health care and in planning public health interventions.","Gaygısız Ümmügülsüm, Lajunen Timo, Gaygısız Esma",Journal of infection and public health,2017,28209467,,10.1016/j.jiph.2016.11.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28209467,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
How Prepared Are Medical and Nursing Students to Identify Common Hazards in the Intensive Care Unit?,"Care in the hospital is hazardous. Harm in the hospital may prolong hospitalization, increase suffering, result in death, and increase costs of care. Although the interprofessional team is critical to eliminating hazards that may result in adverse events to patients, professional students' formal education may not prepare them adequately for this role. To determine if medical and nursing students can identify hazards of hospitalization that could result in harm to patients and to detect differences between professions in the types of hazards identified. Mixed-methods observational study of graduating nursing (n = 51) and medical (n = 93) students who completed two ""Room of Horrors"" simulations to identify patient safety hazards. Qualitative analysis was used to extract themes from students' written hazard descriptions. Fisher's exact test was used to determine differences in frequency of hazards identified between groups. Identification of hazards by students was low: 66% did not identify missing personal protective equipment for a patient on contact isolation, and 58% did not identify a medication administration error (medication hanging for a patient with similar name). Interprofessional differences existed in how hazards were identified: medical students noted that restraints were not indicated (73 vs. 2%, P < 0.001), whereas nursing students noted that there was no order for the restraints (58.5 vs. 0%, P < 0.0001). Nursing students discovered more issues with malfunctioning or incorrectly used equipment than medical students. Teams performed better than individuals, especially for hazards in the second simulation that were similar to those in the first: need to replace a central line with erythema (73% teams identified) versus need to replace a peripheral intravenous line (10% individuals, P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, teams of students missed many intensive care unit-specific hazards: 54% failed to identify the presence of pressure ulcers; 85% did not notice high tidal volumes on the ventilator; and 90% did not identify the absence of missing spontaneous awakening/breathing trials and absent stress ulcer prophylaxis. Graduating nursing and medical students missed several hazards of hospitalization, especially those related to the intensive care unit. Orientation for residents and new nurses should include education on hospitalization hazards. Ideally, this orientation should be interprofessional to allow appreciation for each other's roles and responsibilities.","Clay Alison S, Chudgar Saumil M, Turner Kathleen M, Vaughn Jacqueline, Knudsen Nancy W, Farnan Jeanne M, Arora Vineet M, Molloy Margory A",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,2017,28157394,,10.1513/AnnalsATS.201610-773OC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28157394,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Orientation for residents and new nurses should include education on hospitalization hazards.

Binding and Proton Blockage by Amantadine Variants of the Influenza M2<sub>WT</sub> and M2<sub>S31N</sub> Explained.,"While aminoadamantanes are well-established inhibitors of the influenza A M2 proton channel, the mechanisms by which they are rendered ineffective against M2<sub>S31N</sub> are unclear. Solid state NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, electrophysiology, antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations suggest stronger binding interactions for aminoadamantanes to M2<sub>WT</sub> compared to negligible or weak binding to M2<sub>S31N</sub>. This is due to reshaping of the M2 pore when N31 is present, which, in contrast to wild-type (WT), leads (A) to the loss of the V27 pocket for the adamantyl cage and to a predominant orientation of the ligand's ammonium group toward the N-terminus and (B) to the lack of a helical kink upon ligand binding. The kink, which reduces the tilt of the C-terminal helical domain relative to the bilayer normal, includes the W41 primary gate for proton conductance and may prevent the gate from opening, representing an alternative view for how these drugs prevent proton conductance.","Tzitzoglaki Christina, Wright Anna, Freudenberger Kathrin, Hoffmann Anja, Tietjen Ian, Stylianakis Ioannis, Kolarov Felix, Fedida David, Schmidtke Michaela, Gauglitz Günter, Cross Timothy A, Kolocouris Antonios",Journal of medicinal chemistry,2017,28107633,PMC9308172,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01115,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28107633,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9308172,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Using medical specialty and selection criteria clusters to study specialty selection by Israeli medical students.,"During their final year of medical school, Israeli students must consider which specialty to choose for residency. Based on the vocational counseling literature we presumed that choices are made by selecting from a cluster of related specialties while considering professional and socio-economic issues. Questionnaires distributed to final-year medical students at two Israeli medical schools ascertained inclinations toward various medical specialties and the importance of various selection criteria. Analysis focused on seven specialties where >20% of students reported they had positive inclinations. For each such specialty, the specialty and selection criteria query were compared using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests to determine differences between students with positive inclinations toward the specialty with those not so inclined. These data were placed in tables, with the significant differences highlighted to facilitate visual recognition of cluster patterns. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 317 of 455 students. Students often had positive inclinations toward more than one specialty (specialty clusters) associated with a group of selection criteria (selection criteria clusters). For example, interest in internal medicine was clustered with interest in internal medicine subspecialties, cardiology and research. Furthermore, there was a ""reciprocal"" aspect to some specialty cluster patterns. For example, those interested in internal medicine had little interest in surgical specialties. Selection criteria clusters revealed occupational interests and socio-environmental factors associated with the specialty clusters. For example, family medicine, which clustered with pediatrics and psychiatry, had a sub-cluster of: Bedside specialty with family orientation affording long-term patient care. Another sub-cluster was time for childrearing and family, only daytime work and outpatient care. Clusters also revealed students' perceptions that differed from expected: Cardiology is changing from a cognitive to a procedure-oriented subspecialty, clustering not only with internal medicine and its subspecialties but also with emergency medicine, surgical subspecialties and anesthesiology. The concept that career choice involves selecting from a cluster of related specialties provides information about the specialties students might be considering. Moreover, students are not only looking for individual aspects of a specialty, but for a package including clusters of socio-economic and occupational features. Practically, examining clusters can help in career counseling of medical students and assist residency program directors in marketing their specialties.","Weiss Yoram G, Zisk-Rony Rachel Yaffa, Tandeter Howard, Elchalal Uriel, Avidan Alex, Schroeder Josh E, Weissman Charles",BMC medical education,2017,28100274,PMC5241925,10.1186/s12909-017-0854-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28100274,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241925,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Mentorship in anesthesia: a survey of perspectives among Canadian anesthesia residents.,"Mentorship is important for professional and academic growth; however, the role of mentorship in anesthesia is still being defined. We surveyed Canadian anesthesia residents to explore their perceptions of mentorship relationships. We administered a 20-item cross-sectional survey to program directors and anesthesia residents in all Canadian departments of anesthesia. Program directors were asked about their mentorship programs, and residents were asked about their perceptions of benefits and barriers to effective mentoring. Sixteen of 17 (94%) program directors and 189 of 585 (32%) anesthesia residents responded to our survey. While 143 of 180 (79%) residents agreed that mentorship was beneficial to overall success as an anesthesiologist, only 11 of 16 (69%) program directors reported formal mentorship as part of their residency program, and only 119 of 189 (63%) residents reported access to a mentor. Barriers reported by residents included insufficient time with mentors, lack of formalized meeting times and objectives, mentor-mentee incompatibility (personal or professional), and lack of resident choice in mentor selection. Our study confirms that, despite positive perceptions among residents, mentorship remains underutilized in anesthesia programs. We identify barriers to effective mentorship, including the need to consider resident choice as a means to improve formal anesthesia mentorship programs.","Ergun Suzan, Busse Jason W, Wong Anne",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2017,28092066,,10.1007/s12630-017-0816-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28092066,,TRUE,formal mentorship programs in anesthesia residency,Canadian anesthesia residents,"improved professional and academic growth, overall success as an anesthesiologist",TRUE,Mentorship programs,Canadian anesthesia residents,Improved success as an anesthesiologist
A qualitative exploration of anesthesia trainees' experiences during transition to a children's hospital.,"The stresses of starting a new job can make anyone feel tired and inefficient. In health care, this may impair the ability to learn at a time when there is most to learn, and increase the risk of error in a context where errors may lead to patient harm. The aim of this study was to understand issues which influence anesthesia trainees' transition to a pediatric setting. This qualitative study utilized in-depth semi-structured interviews to gather data from 31 anesthesia trainees who had commenced work at a tertiary children's hospital between 4 and 6 weeks previously. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Two key themes were identified: feeling ineffective, which appeared to have both a cognitive component (feeling disoriented) and an emotional component (feeling useless), and feeling anxious or afraid. Trainees found the pediatric environment highly unfamiliar, which made them feel disoriented, inefficient, and at times incompetent. Many experienced difficulty identifying a useful role in a highly specialized area of practice, leading to loss of identity as an expert clinician. Many described an ever-present fear of making an anesthetic error or being unable to manage a rapidly evolving clinical situation. Some trainees developed a negative mindset, which was reinforced by subsequent perceived failures. Overall, these experiences impeded trainees' ability to concentrate and learn. The impact of disorientation and anxiety on anesthesia trainees as they adapt to a highly specialized clinical environment such as a children's hospital should not be underestimated. Study findings illustrate the importance of helping new trainees to feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in assessing their own performance during the transition period.","Howe Peter W, Kumar Koshila",Paediatric anaesthesia,2017,27878890,,10.1111/pan.13064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27878890,,TRUE,qualitative study exploring transition experiences to identify issues affecting anesthesia trainees during onboarding,anesthesia trainees transitioning to a tertiary children's hospital,"understanding factors that impede learning and performance during transition to inform better onboarding approaches that help trainees feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in self-assessment",TRUE,Not specified in the abstract,Anesthesia trainees who had commenced work at a tertiary children's hospital,"Helping new trainees to feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in assessing their own performance during the transition period"
Fluorine-19 NMR and computational quantification of isoflurane binding to the voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac.,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>) play an important role in general anesthesia. Electrophysiology measurements suggest that volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane inhibit Na<sub>V</sub> by stabilizing the inactivated state or altering the inactivation kinetics. Recent computational studies suggested the existence of multiple isoflurane binding sites in Na<sub>V</sub>, but experimental binding data are lacking. Here we use site-directed placement of <sup>19</sup>F probes in NMR experiments to quantify isoflurane binding to the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac. <sup>19</sup>F probes were introduced individually to S129 and L150 near the S4-S5 linker, L179 and S208 at the extracellular surface, T189 in the ion selectivity filter, and all phenylalanine residues. Quantitative analyses of <sup>19</sup>F NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) spectroscopy showed a strong interaction of isoflurane with S129, T189, and S208; relatively weakly with L150; and almost undetectable with L179 and phenylalanine residues. An orientation preference was observed for isoflurane bound to T189 and S208, but not to S129 and L150. We conclude that isoflurane inhibits NaChBac by two distinct mechanisms: (i) as a channel blocker at the base of the selectivity filter, and (ii) as a modulator to restrict the pivot motion at the S4-S5 linker and at a critical hinge that controls the gating and inactivation motion of S6.","Kinde Monica N, Bondarenko Vasyl, Granata Daniele, Bu Weiming, Grasty Kimberly C, Loll Patrick J, Carnevale Vincenzo, Klein Michael L, Eckenhoff Roderic G, Tang Pei, Xu Yan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2016,27856739,PMC5137747,10.1073/pnas.1609939113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27856739,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137747,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Anesthesiology Resident Wellness Program at the University of Saskatchewan: concept and development.,"We describe the need for an anesthesiology resident wellness program (ARWP) and the challenges associated with its development and implementation. We also present the results of a preliminary program evaluation. We conducted a needs assessment of Canadian anesthesiology residency programs for a formal ARWP. This endeavor involved both a cross-sectional survey and a focus group of Canadian anesthesiology residency training program directors (PDs). Following the development and implementation of an ARWP at our own university, we conducted an evaluation. The quantitative data are reported using descriptive statistics. Common themes were generated from qualitative data through an iterative process. Among the 18 PDs across Canada, 10 (56%) responded to the needs assessment. The PDs identified that resident wellness was important to the delivery of their programs but that very few had a formal wellness curriculum. This informed the further development of the ARWP over two years to comprise a Modular Curriculum, a Peer Support Curriculum, Self-Directed Learning Activities, and a Department Wellness Program. Online evaluation of the ARWP was completed by 28 of 31 (90%) of our anesthesiology residents, who reported high levels of satisfaction with the ARWP, the relevance of the topics, and the applicability of skills and information to both work and daily life. Respondents identified Team Building Activities, Mentorship and Orientation, Resident Wellness Nights, and Transitions to Practice Night as the most valuable components of the ARWP.

A simple blind placement of the left-sided double-lumen tubes.,"One-lung ventilation (OLV) has been commonly provided by using a double-lumen tube (DLT). Previous reports have indicated the high incidence of inappropriate DLT positioning in conventional maneuvers.After obtaining approval from the medical ethics committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and written consent from patients, 88 adult patients belonging to American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status grade I or II, and undergoing elective thoracic surgery requiring a left-side DLT for OLV were enrolled in this prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: simple maneuver group or conventional maneuver group. The simple maneuver is a method that relies on partially inflating the bronchial balloon and recreating the effect of a carinal hook on the DLTs to give an idea of orientation and depth. After the induction of anesthesia the patients were intubated with a left-sided Robertshaw DLT using one of the 2 intubation techniques. After intubation of each DLT, an anesthesiologist used flexible bronchoscopy to evaluate the patient while the patient lay in a supine position. The number of optimal position and the time required to place DLT in correct position were recorded.Time for the intubation of DLT took 100 ± 16.2 seconds (mean ± SD) in simple maneuver group and 95.1 ± 20.8 seconds in conventional maneuver group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.221). Time for fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) took 22 ± 4.8 seconds in simple maneuver group and was statistically faster than that in conventional maneuver group (43.6 ± 23.7 seconds, P < 0.001). Nearly 98% of the 44 intubations in simple maneuver group were considered as in optimal position while only 52% of the 44 intubations in conventional maneuver group were in optimal position, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).This simple maneuver is more rapid and more accurate to position left-sided DLTs, it may be substituted for FOB during positioning of a left-sided DLT in condition that FOB is unavailable or inapplicable.","Zong Zhi Jun, Shen Qi Ying, Lu Yao, Li Yuan Hai",Medicine,2016,27828867,PMC5106073,10.1097/MD.0000000000005376,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27828867,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5106073,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
[Anesthesia for medical students : A brief guide to practical anesthesia in adults with a web-based video illustration].,"In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, anesthesiologists are the second largest group of physicians in hospitals, but this does not correspond to the amount of anesthesiology teaching that medical students receive in medical schools. Accordingly, the chances of medical students recognizing anesthesiology as a promising personal professional career are smaller than in other disciplines with large teaching components. Subsequent difficulties to recruit anesthesiology residents are likely, although many reasons support anesthesiology as a professional career.Traditional strategies to teach medical students in anesthesiology in medical school consist of airway management or cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts in manikins. Anesthesiology is a complex interaction consisting of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, clinical evaluation, experience, knowledge, and manual skills. While some medical schools offer teaching in high fidelity simulators, clinical teaching in the operating room is often limited. When medical students opt for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology, there is a chance to demonstrate the fascinating world of anesthesiology, but this chance has to be utilized carefully by anesthesiologists, as young talents have to be discovered, supported, and challenged.We have put together a short guide for medical students for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology in adults in order to generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology as well as a sense of achievement. Basic knowledge about premedication, induction, maintenance and strategies for anesthesia is discussed. Further, the most important anesthesia drugs are discussed and manual skills, such as intravenous cannulation, mask ventilation, intubation, and regional anesthesia are featured with QR-code based video illustrations on a smartphone or personal computer. We did not discuss possible local mannerism and special patient groups (e. g., children, special medical history), local guidelines, or standard operating procedures.Medical students can be inspired by anesthesiology when not simply told about the tools of the trade and strategies, but instead by gaining knowledge and clinical skills that render a sense of achievement, likely during a clinical rotation into anesthesiology. A short theoretical instruction of anesthesiology enables rapid and targeted orientation even before a clinical rotation. Whether this subsequently results in a higher recruiting chance is currently unknown.","Mathis S, Schlafer O, Abram J, Kreutziger J, Paal P, Wenzel V",Der Anaesthesist,2016,27787571,,10.1007/s00101-016-0231-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27787571,,TRUE,"A brief guide for medical students during clinical rotation in anesthesiology, including basic knowledge about premedication, induction, maintenance, anesthesia strategies, important drugs, and manual skills with QR-code based video illustrations",Medical students during clinical rotation in anesthesiology,"Generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology, provide a sense of achievement, and potentially improve recruitment of anesthesiology residents",TRUE,"Short guide for medical students for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology in adults to generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology as well as a sense of achievement.

"Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks: An Update of the Published Evidence and Comparison With Novel, Alternative Analgesic Modalities.","A continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB) consists of a percutaneously inserted catheter with its tip adjacent to a target nerve/plexus through which local anesthetic may be administered, providing a prolonged block that may be titrated to the desired effect. In the decades after its first report in 1946, a plethora of data relating to CPNB was published, much of which was examined in a 2011 Anesthesia & Analgesia article. The current update is an evidence-based review of the CPNB literature published in the interim. Novel insertion sites include the adductor canal, interpectoral, quadratus lumborum, lesser palatine, ulnar, superficial, and deep peroneal nerves. Noteworthy new indications include providing analgesia after traumatic rib/femur fracture, manipulation for adhesive capsulitis, and treating abdominal wall pain during pregnancy. The preponderance of recently published evidence suggests benefits nearly exclusively in favor of catheter insertion using ultrasound guidance compared with electrical stimulation, although little new data are available to help guide practitioners regarding the specifics of ultrasound-guided catheter insertion (eg, optimal needle-nerve orientation). After some previous suggestions that automated, repeated bolus doses could provide benefits over a basal infusion, there is a dearth of supporting data published in the past few years. An increasing number of disposable infusion pumps does now allow a similar ability to adjust basal rates, bolus volume, and lockout times compared with their electronic, programmable counterparts, and a promising area of research is communicating with and controlling pumps remotely via the Internet. Large, prospective studies now document the relatively few major complications during ambulatory CPNB, although randomized, controlled studies demonstrating an actual shortening of hospitalization duration are few. Recent evidence suggests that, compared with femoral infusion, adductor canal catheters both induce less quadriceps femoris weakness and improve mobilization/ambulation, although the relative analgesia afforded by each remains in dispute. Newly published data demonstrate that the incidence and/or severity of chronic, persistent postsurgical pain may, at times, be decreased with a short-term postoperative CPNB. Few new CPNB-related complications have been identified, although large, prospective trials provide additional data regarding the incidence of adverse events. Lastly, a number of novel, alternative analgesic modalities are under development/investigation. Four such techniques are described and contrasted with CPNB, including single-injection peripheral nerve blocks with newer adjuvants, liposome bupivacaine used in wound infiltration and peripheral nerve blocks, cryoanalgesia with cryoneurolysis, and percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation.",Ilfeld Brian M,Anesthesia and analgesia,2017,27749354,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000001581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749354,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Towards a new orientation: a qualitative longitudinal study of an intensive care recovery programme.,"To describe the patient experience of ICU recovery from a longitudinal perspective by analysing follow-up consultations at three time-points. After a stay in the intensive care unit, patients risk physical and psychological problems during recovery. Follow-up after intensive care has emerged to aid psychological recovery, and improve health-related quality of life. More insight is needed into the mechanisms of intensive care recovery. A descriptive multicenter longitudinal qualitative design. A subsample of 36 consultations with 12 patients strategically selected from a randomised controlled trial on intensive care recovery from 10 Danish intensive care units. Data were generated during an ICU recovery programme including three consultations (at 1-3, 4-5, 9-11 months). First consultation was face-to-face using patient photographs to aid memory. Second and third consultations were by telephone using reflection sheets to focus dialogue. Thematic analysis and narrative theory were used to explore mechanisms of recovery using audio-recordings of consultations, patient photographs and reflection sheets as the sources of data. The basic narrative of recovery was 'toward a trajectory of new orientation'. This narrative contained the chronological narratives of being 'at death's door', 'still not out of the woods' and 'on the road to recovery'. The road to recovery was described as downhill, steady-state or progressive. New orientation was obtained in steady-state or progressive recovery. This study provides a contemporary understanding of the process of intensive care recovery. Recovery evolves through narratives of mortal danger, risk of relapse and moving forward towards a new orientation in life. These findings enable health care professionals to understand what patients experience during stages of recovery. This is important to improve health care professionals in the assessment of long-term outcome, and management of patients after intensive care.","Jensen Janet F, Overgaard Dorthe, Bestle Morten H, Christensen Doris F, Egerod Ingrid",Journal of clinical nursing,2017,27667681,,10.1111/jocn.13372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27667681,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
[Effects of using different dose of dexmedetomidine during tracheal extubation for patients with parotidectomy after general anesthesia].,"To observe the effects of using different-dose dexmedetomidine during tracheal extubation for patients with parotidectomy after general anesthesia. Eighty patients with ""ASA I-II""scheduled for parotidectomy under general anesthesia were randomly divided into 4 groups, dexmedetomidine group (D1, D2, D3 group) and control group (C group), 20 cases in each group. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were the same. Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, patients in group D1,D2,D3 and group C were infused dexmedetomidine 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 μg/kg diluted to 20 mL and the same volume of normal saline respectively within 10 minutes. After surgery, all patients were sent to the PACU. Extubation was applied to the patients who had extubation indications. SBP, DBP and HR were recorded at each time-point including T0(before induction), T1（the time when extubation, T2(5 min after extubation) and T3(10 min after extubation).The conditions of patients' bucking and agitation in PACU were also recorded. Other recorded indications included Ramsay scores and NRS at the time of extubation, extubation time and orientation recovery time. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS20.0 software package. SBP, DBP and HR at the time of extubation in group C, D1 increased significantly compared with those before extubation (P<0.05). SBP, DBP and HR in group D1 had no significant difference at T0, T1, T2 and T3 from those in group C (P>0.05). Ramsay scores and NRS in group D1 had no significant difference from those in group C (P>0.05). The incidence and degree of bucking in group D1 had declining tendency, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05).

The incidence and degree of bucking and agitation in group D2, D3 were lower and lighter than those in group C, D1 and Ramsay scores, NRS also had significant difference (P<0.05). Ramsay scores in group D3 were higher than those in group D2, and NRS in group D3 were significantly lower (P<0.05). Extubation time and orientation recovery time of group D3 were significantly longer than those in group D1, D2 and C (P<0.05). Dexmedetomidine infusion before the end of parotidectomy can reduce hemodynamic fluctuation during the recovery period and improve the recovery quality. Moderate dose of dexmedetomidine (0.8 μg/kg) was more secure, and would not extend the extubation and orientation recovery time.","Liu Hua, Zhou Chi, Ji Jun",Shanghai kou qiang yi xue = Shanghai journal of stomatology,2016,27609395,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27609395,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A survey of residency program directors in anesthesiology regarding mentorship of residents.,"Mentorship of residents has been extensively studied within many academic specialties, but not anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of formal mentorship programs among anesthesia residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the United States by surveying residency directors. The secondary goals of the study are to describe the programs that exist and identify areas that residency directors think should be the focus of mentoring. Our survey was designed based on previous surveys administered to residency program directors from other specialties. After determination of exempt status by our institutional review board, the survey was administered via e-mail to program directors of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited anesthesiology residencies. Response rate was 34% (45/131). The sample consisted of mainly university-based programs (93%). Most (88%) had a mentorship program in place. There was little consistency between methods of forming faculty-resident mentor pairs. Most mentors (84%) and mentees (79%) did not evaluate their programs. Nearly all program directors agree that mentorship is an important tool for resident development (90.6%) and that it is important to have a mentor during training (90.6%). Program directors identified the areas of career planning, professionalism, and achieving a balance between personal, career, and family demands to be the most valuable subjects to address in a mentoring relationship. Anesthesiology is currently underrepresented in the trainee mentoring literature. There is significant support for mentorship during resident training; however, the low rates of training for faculty and minimal evaluation by residents and faculty raise the question as to the efficacy of the existing programs. There is a need for more investigation of anesthesia residents' goals and perceptions of mentorship, and a more detailed evaluation of existing mentorship programs to determine the ideal structure of a mentoring program.","Gonzalez Laura Shank, Donnelly Melanie J",Journal of clinical anesthesia,2016,27555175,,10.1016/j.jclinane.2016.03.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27555175,,TRUE,formal mentorship programs for anesthesiology residents,anesthesiology residents in ACGME-accredited programs,"resident development in career planning, professionalism, and work-life balance",TRUE,"Mentorship program for residents, with methods of forming faculty-resident mentor pairs varying across programs.",Anesthesia residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the United States.,"Improved resident development, career planning, professionalism, and achieving a balance between personal, career, and family demands.

Less invasive surgery using external fixator for the treatment of subtrochanteric femur fracture in a high-risk geriatric patient.,"A 90-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic complaining of pain in her left hip which occurred due to fall from a chair. Her medical history included memory loss and mental changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and depression. Patient's cooperation and orientation were weak. Range of motion of the left hip was restricted and painful. Radiographs of the left hip demonstrated subtrochanteric comminuted fracture of femur. Laboratory tests revealed anemia and liver insufficiency. Departments of internal medicine and anesthesiology reported high risk for surgery. Surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia on radiolucent table and in supine position. Using fluoroscopy, subtrochanteric comminuted fracture of femur was reduced. Proximally, two Schanz screws were placed through femoral neck and head in axial plane, and distally, three Schanz screws were placed through femoral shaft in coronal plane. Finally, fixation of the screws was achieved with an external fixator which was made of carbon fiber rods. Patient was allowed to sit in the bed and move around with a wheelchair as of the day of surgery. No infection or loosening of fixator occurred.","Atik O Şahap, Can Fatih I, Şenol M Selçuk, Eren Toygun K",Eklem hastaliklari ve cerrahisi = Joint diseases & related surgery,2016,27499322,,10.5606/ehc.2016.21,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27499322,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Pilot Study: The Role of Predeployment Ethics Training, Professional Ethics, and Religious Values on Naval Physicians' Ethical Decision Making.","Military physicians serving overseas in cross-cultural settings face the challenge of meeting patients' needs and adhering to their personal and professional ethics while abiding by military obligations and duties. Predeployment ethics training for Naval physicians continues to be received in many forms, if received at all, and has largely not addressed their specific roles as medical providers in the military. This study explores the perceived effectiveness of predeployment ethics training received by Naval physicians. Additionally, it considers the contribution of different types of ethics training, religious values, and the professional ethics on Naval physicians' perceived ability to effectively manage ethically challenging scenarios while on deployment. A total of 49 Naval physicians participated in an online survey. 16.3% reported not receiving any form of ethics training before deployment. Of those that reported receiving ethics training before deployment, 92.7% found the ethics training received was helpful in some way while on deployment. While a medical school course was most contributory overall to their ability to handle ethically difficult situations while on deployment (70.7%), what most Naval physicians felt would help them better handle these types of situations would be a mandatory military training/military course (63.2%) or personal mentorship (57.9%).","Gaidry Alicia D, Hoehner Paul J",Military medicine,2016,27483515,,10.7205/MILMED-D-15-00104,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27483515,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,"Predeployment ethics training, mandatory military training/military course, personal mentorship",Naval physicians,Improved ability to manage ethically challenging scenarios while on deployment
Robotic atrial septal defect closure and tricuspid annuloplasty in a case of situs inversus totalis with dextrocardia.,"Situs inversus totalis (SIT) with dextrocardia is an uncommon congenital positional anomaly, which is characterized by a symmetrical 'mirror-image' orientation of all organs in relation to the midline. Although sternotomy and thoracotomy is traditionally used in patients with SIT with dextrocardia, a totally endoscopic robotic surgery is an alternative surgical approach to intracardiac anomalies. Placement of robotic ports, transthoracic aortic clamp, cardioplegia delivery, and peripheral vascular cannulation is made from the left side of the chest, as a mirror orientation of the right-sided robotic cardiac procedures. Here, we present a patient who underwent concomitant robotic atrial septal defect closure and tricuspid annuloplasty with posterior plication using the da Vinci surgical system.","Onan Burak, Aydin Unal, Kahraman Zeynep, Bakir Ihsan",Journal of robotic surgery,2017,27344445,,10.1007/s11701-016-0619-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27344445,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Direct-current Stimulation and Multi-electrode Array Recording of Seizure-like Activity in Mice Brain Slice Preparation.,"Cathodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) induces suppressive effects on drug-resistant seizures. To perform effective actions, the stimulation parameters (e.g., orientation, field strength, and stimulation duration) need to be examined in mice brain slice preparations. Testing and arranging the orientation of the electrode relative to the position of the mice brain slice are feasible. The present method preserves the thalamocingulate pathway to evaluate the effect of DCS on anterior cingulate cortex seizure-like activities. The results of the multichannel array recordings indicated that cathodal DCS significantly decreased the amplitude of the stimulation-evoked responses and duration of 4-aminopyridine and bicuculline-induced seizure-like activity. This study also found that cathodal DCS applications at 15 min caused long-term depression in the thalamocingulate pathway. The present study investigates the effects of DCS on thalamocingulate synaptic plasticity and acute seizure-like activities. The current procedure can test the optimal stimulation parameters including orientation, field strength, and stimulation duration in an in vitro mouse model. Also, the method can evaluate the effects of DCS on cortical seizure-like activities at both the cellular and network levels.","Lu Hsiang-Chin, Chang Wei-Jen, Chang Wei-Pang, Shyu Bai-Chuang",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2016,27341682,PMC4927765,10.3791/53709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27341682,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927765,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Factors Influencing the Choice of Anesthesia as a Career by Undergraduates of the University of Rwanda.,"Rwanda currently faces a severe shortage of trained medical personnel, including physician anesthesiologists. The recruitment of residents into the anesthesia program has been consistently low. This study aimed at determining the factors that influence undergraduates' decision to pursue anesthesia as a career choice. A questionnaire was created and administered to final year undergraduate medical students at the University of Rwanda. The questionnaire was created based on factors identified from literature review and key informant interviews. The questionnaire was translated, field-tested, and refined. The final survey questionnaire contains 27 4-point Likert scale items and 4 free-text questions. Seventy-nine final year undergraduate medical students responded to the survey. Only 2 students (2.5%) chose anesthesia as their top choice for postgraduate training. The most frequently named factors for not choosing anesthesiology were long work hours and high stress level, insufficient mentorship, and low job opportunity. The issues identified by our survey must be considered when making efforts toward increasing anesthesia recruitment in Rwanda. Factors such as lack of material resources and high workload will not be easily addressed. Others can be addressed through changes in medical student anesthesiology rotations and better mentorship by anesthesiologists during formative years. Focusing on factors that can be changed now may increase enrollment into anesthesiology. Future studies will include broadening the survey population and further investigating the influencing factors elucidated by this study.","Chan Denise M, Wong Rex, Runnels Sean, Muhizi Epaphrodite, McClain Craig D",Anesthesia and analgesia,2016,27308955,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000001433,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27308955,,FALSE,,,,TRUE,Better mentorship by anesthesiologists during formative years,Undergraduate medical students at the University of Rwanda,Increase enrollment into anesthesiology
Influence of catheter orientation on lesion formation in bovine myocardium by using an open-irrigated laser ablation catheter.,"Lesion sizes and quality are crucial for successful catheter ablation procedures. We sought to test the influence of catheter orientation towards the endocardial surface on lesion formation in bovine myocardium by using an open-irrigated laser ablation catheter. Continuous wave 1064-nm laser catheter applications at 15 W (4.5 W/mm²)/30 s, (135 J/mm²), irrigation flow 30 mL/min, were aimed at the left ventricular endocardial surface of bovine myocardium. The catheter was kept in vertical, in slanting (67.5°, 45°, 22.5°), and in flat positions; in flat position, also 60 s of radiation times were applied (n = 10, each). Lesions were evaluated morphometrically. Maximum depth of lesion was achieved with the catheter in a vertical orientation. Catheter inclination of <22.5 showed a highly significant decrease of lesion depth from 5.6 ± 1.1 to 3.7 ± 0.5 mm (p = 0.0001). In a flat catheter position, laser radiation of 30 s achieved the smallest lesions. However, after 60 s of radiation, the flat lesions were similar in depth (p = 087) and were larger in width (p = 0.0004) and in volumes (p = 0.0025) as compared to the lesions achieved with the catheter in vertical position after 30 s of radiation. Steam-pop with intramural cavitation or tissue vaporization with crater formation did not occur. Longer radiation times can achieve larger lesions regardless of catheter orientation. Catheter orientation is not a major determinant for laser ablation lesion size and quality, and a steerable support may not be needed when using the open-irrigated electrode-laser mapping and ablation (ELMA) catheter RytmoLas.","Sagerer-Gerhardt Michaela, Weber Helmut P",Lasers in medical science,2016,27286865,,10.1007/s10103-016-1980-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27286865,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Randomized Double-Blinded Trial on the Effects of Ultrasound Transducer Orientation on Teaching and Learning Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia.,"Learning ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia skills, especially needle/ beam alignment, can be especially difficulty for trainees, who can often become frustrated. We hypothesized that teaching novices to orient the transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders will improve performance on a standardized task, compared to holding the transducer and needle parallel to the shoulders. This study compared the effects of transducer orientation on trainees' ability to complete a standardized ultrasound-guided nerve block simulation. The time to task completion and percentage of the attempt time without adequate needle visualization were measured. Participants were right-handed healthy adults with no previous ultrasound experience and were randomly assigned to training in either transducer and needle alignment in a coronal plane, parallel to the shoulders (parallel group) or transducer and needle alignment in a sagittal plane, perpendicular to the shoulders (perpendicular group). Participants used ultrasound to direct a needle to 3 targets in a standardized gelatin phantom and repeated this task 3 times. Their efforts were timed and evaluated by an assessor, who was blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed on 28 participants. The perpendicular group was able to complete the task more quickly (P < .001) and with a smaller proportion of time lost to inadequate needle visualization (P < .001). Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia trainees complete a standardized task more quickly and efficiently when instructed to hold the transducer and needle in an orientation perpendicular to their shoulders.","Lam Nicholas C K, Baker Elizabeth B, Fishburn Steven J, Hammer Angie R, Petersen Timothy R, Mariano Edward R",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,2016,27246662,,10.7863/ultra.15.09031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27246662,,TRUE,Teaching novices to orient the ultrasound transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders when learning ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Trainees/novices learning ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia skills,"Improved performance, faster task completion, and better needle visualization during ultrasound-guided nerve block procedures",TRUE,Teaching novices to orient the transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Right-handed healthy adults with no previous ultrasound experience,Trainees complete a standardized task more quickly and efficiently
Should Early Prone Positioning Be a Standard of Care in ARDS With Refractory Hypoxemia?,"For the past 4 decades, the prone position has been employed as an occasional rescue option for patients with severe hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional measures applied in the supine orientation. Proning offers a high likelihood of significantly improved arterial oxygenation to well selected patients, but until the results of a convincing randomized trial were published, its potential to reduce mortality risk remained in serious doubt. Proning does not benefit patients of all disease severities and stages but may be life-saving for others. Because it requires advanced nursing skills and escalation of monitoring surveillance to deploy safely, its place as an early stage standard of care depends on the definition of that label.","Marini John J, Josephs Sean A, Mechlin Maggie, Hurford William E",Respiratory care,2016,27235316,,10.4187/respcare.04562,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27235316,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"A peer-designed selective in anesthesiology, critical care, and perioperative medicine for first- and second-year medical students.","The objective of this study was to design and implement a preclinical elective (termed selective) in anesthesiology, critical care, and perioperative medicine and to report survey results assessing the impact of the selective on first- and second-year medical students' understanding of basic concepts, comfort with procedural skills, and interest in the specialty. Preinvention and postintervention survey evaluation was used as the design of this study. The study was conducted at Mayo Medical School and Mayo Clinic. The participants in this study are first- and second-year medical students. A 1-week introductory anesthesiology curriculum was developed to include didactic sessions, shadowing experiences, lunch and dinner panels, mentorship and networking opportunities, and procedural workshops in airway management, ultrasound, and vascular access techniques.

A total of 8 students participated in the selective, with a 100% survey response rate. Students reported significant increases for all survey questions regarding basic concepts and skills. The largest increases were reported in comfort with airway management skills, understanding of the perioperative surgical home model, and vascular access skills. All participants indicated a higher likelihood of pursuing anesthesiology as a career and attributed their increased interest in anesthesiology to the selective. This new selective was successful in giving first- and second-year medical students a comprehensive overview of anesthesiology and increasing medical student interest in the specialty.

Comparison of recovery effect for sufentanil and remifentanil anesthesia with TCI in laparoscopic radical resection during colorectal cancer.,"The aim of the present study was to compare the recovery of sufentanil and remifentanil anesthesia by target-controlled infusion (TCI) in elderly patients with laparoscopic-assisted radical resection of colorectal cancer. The effect of anesthesia on patient stress response and cellular immune function was also observed. Elderly patients (n=192) who underwent laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer between July 2014 and October 2015 were randomly divided into the sufentanil and remifentanil groups (n=96 per group). The two groups used sufentanil- and remifentanil-based anesthesia by TCI. The wake-up time, extubation time, orientation recovery time, vital signs, stress response, distribution of T-cell subsets and incidence of adverse reactions were recorded and compared. The wake-up and extubation times of the remifentanil group were significantly shorter than those of the sufentanil group. The difference of orientation recovery time was not statistically significant. The differences in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation following anesthesia and during surgery and those prior to anesthesia of the sufentanil group were not statistically significant. However, those of the remifentanil group significantly improved following anesthesia. The concentrations of glucose, cortisol (COR), and interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were stable in the sufentanil group, whereas the indices in the remifentanil group had a tendency of increasing during the anesthesia and surgery, and had a longer postoperative recovery time. The decreasing degree of T-cell subsets in the sufentanil group was significantly lower than that in the remifentanil group, and had a short recovery of cellular immunity following surgery. The adverse reactions rate during anesthesia of the remifentanil group was significantly higher than that of the sufentanil group. In conclusion, sufentanil- and remifentanil-based anesthesia with TCI has certain advantages, including improved recovery effect, less stress response, less inhibition of cellular immunity and fewer adverse reactions. It has the potential to become the first choice of anesthetic in the clinic for elderly patients who undergo laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer.","Qi Yanyan, Yao Xiangyan, Zhang Beibei, DU Xianhui",Oncology letters,2016,27123117,PMC4841051,10.3892/ol.2016.4394,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27123117,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4841051,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A qualitative study exploring mentorship in anesthesiology: perspectives from both sides of the relationship.,"Mentorship has been shown to improve career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians. There is a current lack of studies investigating factors that either promote or hinder effective mentoring relationships through the perspectives of both faculty and residents. The aim of this study was to ascertain these factors and subsequently to provide guidance on designing residency mentorship programs. We used a qualitative design to examine mentorship experiences at the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology and conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 residents and 12 faculty in the mentorship program. Data were analyzed iteratively using a constant comparative method to identify themes resulting in positive or negative mentorship outcomes. As determined from both mentor and mentee perspectives, a successful mentorship program hinges on three key factors-i.e., the anticipated goals of a mentorship relationship, characteristics of the participants, and the structure of the program. When themes were compared between mentors and mentees, differences in their perception of the goals of the relationship and the structure of the program resulted in cases of disillusionment and negative mentorship outcomes. The concept of a mentorship network emerged as a possible solution that would meet the evolving needs of mentees as they progress through training. The network would involve each mentee acquiring multiple mentors, with each providing guidance for a mentee's diverse areas of interest. We identified three key factors that facilitate or hinder mentorship relationships and proposed solutions for designing effective mentorship programs for postgraduate training programs.","Alisic Sarika, Boet Sylvain, Sutherland Stephanie, Bould M Dylan",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2016,27060087,,10.1007/s12630-016-0649-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27060087,,TRUE,Mentorship program with a proposed mentorship network where mentees acquire multiple mentors for guidance in diverse areas of interest,Residents and faculty in the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology,"Improved career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians through effective mentorship relationships",TRUE,"Designing residency mentorship programs, with the concept of a mentorship network where each mentee acquires multiple mentors for diverse areas of interest.",Residents and faculty in the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology,"Improved career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians.

Virtues Education in Medical School: The Foundation for Professional Formation.,"Studies have shown that medical students have high rates of burnout accompanied by a loss of empathy as they progress through their training. This article describes a course for medical students at The University of Queensland-Ochsner Clinical School in New Orleans, LA, that focuses on the development of virtues and character strengths necessary in the practice of medicine. Staff of the Ochsner Clinical School and of the Institute of Medicine, Education, and Spirituality at Ochsner, a research and consulting group of Ochsner Health System, developed the course. It is a curricular innovation designed to explicitly teach virtues and their associated prosocial behaviors as a means of promoting professional formation among medical students. Virtues are core to the development of prosocial behaviors that are essential for appropriate professional formation. Fourth-year medical students receive instruction in the virtues as part of the required Medicine in Society (MIS) course. The virtues instruction consists of five 3-hour sessions during orientation week of the MIS course and a wrapup session at the end of the 8-week rotation. Six virtues-courage, wisdom, temperance, humanity, transcendence, and justice-are taught in a clinical context, using personal narratives, experiential exercises, contemplative practices, and reflective practices. As of July 2015, 30 medical students had completed and evaluated the virtues course. Ninety-seven percent of students felt the course was well structured. After completing the course, 100% of students felt they understood and could explain the character strengths that improve physician engagement and patient care, 100% of students reported understanding the importance of virtues in the practice of medicine, and 83% felt the course provided a guide to help them deal with the complexities of medical practice. Ninety-three percent of students stated they would use the character strengths for their own well-being, and 90% said they would change their approach to the practice of medicine as a result of this course. Overall, 92% of students rated the course as outstanding or good. We developed a course to teach virtues and their associated prosocial behaviors that are important for the practice of medicine. After completing the course, students self-reported improved understanding of the virtues and their importance to the practice of medicine. We plan further studies to determine if participation in the course leads to less burnout and improved resilience.","Seoane Leonardo, Tompkins Lisa M, De Conciliis Anthony, Boysen Philip G",Ochsner journal,2016,27046405,PMC4795502,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27046405,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4795502,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Patient Preferences for Receiving Education on Venous Thromboembolism Prevention - A Survey of Stakeholder Organizations.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients and is largely preventable. Strategies to decrease the burden of VTE have focused on improving clinicians' prescribing of prophylaxis with relatively less emphasis on patient education. To develop a patient-centered approach to education of patients and their families on VTE: including importance, risk factors, and benefit/harm of VTE prophylaxis in hospital settings. The objective of this study was to develop a patient-centered approach to education of patients and their families on VTE: including importance, risk factors, and benefit/harm of VTE prophylaxis in hospital settings. We implemented a three-phase, web-based survey (SurveyMonkey) between March 2014 and September 2014 and analyzed survey data using descriptive statistics. Four hundred twenty one members of several national stakeholder organizations and a single local patient and family advisory board were invited to participate via email. We assessed participants' preferences for VTE education topics and methods of delivery. Participants wanted to learn about VTE symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and complications in a context that emphasized harm. Although participants were willing to learn using a variety of methods, most preferred to receive education in the context of a doctor-patient encounter. The next most common preferences were for video and paper educational materials. Patients want to learn about the harm associated with VTE through a variety of methods. Efforts to improve VTE prophylaxis and decrease preventable harm from VTE should target the entire continuum of care and a variety of stakeholders including patients and their families.","Popoola Victor O, Lau Brandyn D, Shihab Hasan M, Farrow Norma E, Shaffer Dauryne L, Hobson Deborah B, Kulik Susan V, Zaruba Paul D, Shermock Kenneth M, Kraus Peggy S, Pronovost Peter J, Streiff Michael B, Haut Elliott R",PloS one,2016,27031330,PMC4816559,10.1371/journal.pone.0152084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27031330,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816559,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
The Effects of Different Methods of Anaesthesia for Laparoscopic Radical Gastrectomy with Monitoring of Entropy.,"To investigate the effects of methods of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and combined intravenous and inhaled anaesthesia (CIIA) for laparoscopic radical gastrectomy under the same anaesthetic depth monitored by entropy indices. One hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy were randomly distributed into group I (anaesthetized by TIVA) and group II (anaesthetized by CIIA), each group including 50 patients. TIVA was performed with propofol and remifentanil by means of target controlled infusion (TCI) for the patients in group I. CIIA was performed for patients in group II by inhalation of sevoflurane and continuous infusion of remifentanil after anaesthesia induction, with state entropy (SE) maintained in the range of 45-60 and difference regarding response entropy (RE) and SE less than 10.3. The concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine in plasma from radial artery blood samples were measured and the durations of surgical operation, breathing recovery, extubation, awakening, and postoperative orientation recovery recorded; and 48 h postoperative adverse reactions at the following times: the time at which the patient becomes calm for 5 min after entering the operating theatre (T0); upon completion of pneumoperitoneum (PPT) (T1); 15 min after PPT (T2); intraoperative detection (T3), immediately after extubation (T4); and 15 min after extubation (T5). Comparing the measurements of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine in plasma of the above two groups at the same time, the difference between the measurements at T0 and T2, and T5 were not statistically significant (p>0.05), whereas those at T1, T3, and T4 were statistically significant (p<0.05). Specifically, the measurements for group I were significantly higher than those for group II; the differences regarding the duration of breathing recovery, extubation, and awakening in both groups were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The postoperative orientation recovery duration for group II was significantly less than that that for group I (p<0.05); none of the patients in either group had intraoperative awareness, and the incidence of adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomit, and agitation in both groups was not statistically significantly different (p>0.05). At the same anaesthetic depth, the CIIA method outperforms the TIVA method in suppressing the stress response and obtaining smooth awakening after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for patients with gastric cancer; therefore, the CIIA method has a better anaesthetic effect.","Jiang Aihua, Chen Lin-Jing, Wang Yu-Xia, Li Ming-Chuan, Ding Yong-Bo",Anticancer research,2016,26977029,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26977029,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A Survey of Simulation Utilization in Anesthesiology Residency Programs in the United States.,"Given the evolution of competency-based education and evidence supporting the benefits of incorporating simulation into anesthesiology residency training, simulation will likely play an important role in the training and assessment of anesthesiology residents. Currently, there are little data available regarding the current status of simulation-based curricula across US residency programs. In this study, we assessed simulation-based training and assessment in US anesthesiology programs using a survey designed to elicit information regarding the type, frequency, and content of the simulation courses offered at the 132 Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education-certified anesthesiology training programs. The response rate for the survey was 66%. Although most of the responding programs offered simulation-based courses for interns and residents and during CA-1 orientation, the curriculum varied greatly among programs. Approximately 40% of responding programs use simulation for resident assessment and remediation. The majority of responding programs favored standard simulation-based training as part of residency training (89%), and the most common perceived obstacles to doing so were time, money, and human resources. The results from this survey highlight that there are currently large variations in simulation-based training and assessment among training programs. It also confirms that many program directors feel that standardizing some components of simulation-based education and assessment would be beneficial. Given the positive impact simulation has on skill retention and operating room preparedness, it may be worthwhile to consider developing a standard curriculum.","Rochlen Lauryn R, Housey Michelle, Gannon Ian, Tait Alan R, Naughton Norah, Kheterpal Sachin",A & A case reports,2016,26934609,,10.1213/XAA.0000000000000304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26934609,,TRUE,simulation-based training during CA-1 orientation,anesthesiology residents/interns,improved skill retention and operating room preparedness,TRUE,Simulation-based training and assessment,Anesthesiology residents,Skill retention and operating room preparedness
Desflurane reinforces the efficacy of propofol target-controlled infusion in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Whether low-concentration desflurane reinforces propofol-based intravenous anesthesia on maintenance of anesthesia for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate whether propofol-based anesthesia adding low-concentration desflurane is feasible for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Fifty-two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled in the prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Induction of anesthesia was achieved in all patients with fentanyl 2 μg/kg, lidocaine 1 mg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation and to initiate propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) to effect site concentration (Ce: 4 μg/mL with infusion rate 400 mL/h). The patients were then allocated into either propofol TCI based (group P) or propofol TCI adding low-concentration desflurane (group PD) for maintenance of anesthesia. The peri-anesthesia hemodynamic responses to stimuli were measured. The perioperative psychomotor test included p-deletion test, minus calculation, orientation, and alert/sedation scales. Group PD showed stable hemodynamic responses at CO2 inflation, initial 15 minutes of operation, and recovery from general anesthesia as compared with group P. There is no significant difference between the groups in operation time and anesthesia time, perioperative psychomotor functional tests, postoperative vomiting, and pain score. Based on our findings, the anesthetic technique combination propofol and desflurane for the maintenance of general anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy provided more stable hemodynamic responses than propofol alone. The combined regimen is recommended for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Chen Po-Nien, Lu I-Cheng, Chen Hui-Ming, Cheng Kuang-I, Tseng Kuang-Yi, Lee King-Teh",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2016,26853173,,10.1016/j.kjms.2015.11.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26853173,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Awakening from anesthesia using propofol or sevoflurane with epidural block in radical surgery for senile gastric cancer.,"To study the awakening of the elderly patients from propofol intravenous general anesthesia or sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia combined with epidural block after radical gastric cancer surgery. Eighty cases receiving selective radical surgery for gastric cancer were included. They were aged 65-78 years and classified as ASA grade I-II. Using a random number table, the cases were divided into 4 groups (n = 20): propofol intravenous general anesthesia (P group), sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia (S group), propofol intravenous general anesthesia combined with epidural block (PE group), and sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia combined with epidural block (SE group). For P and PE group, target controlled infusion of propofol was performed; for S and SE group, sevoflurane was inhaled to induce and maintain general anesthesia; for PE and SE group, before general anesthesia induction, epidural puncture and catheterization at T7-8 was performed. After surgery, perform patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) or patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), and maintain VAS ≤ 3. The recorded indicators were as follows: time to recovery of spontaneous respiration, time to awakening, time of endotracheal tube removal, time to orientation, time to achieve modified Aldrete scores ≥ 9, modified OAA/S and Aldrete scores upon endotracheal tube removal (T1), 5 min after removal (T2), 15 min after removal (T3) and 30 min after removal (T4), dose of intraoperative remifentanil, intraoperative hypotension, and emergence agitation. Time to awakening, time of endotracheal tube removal, time to orientation, and time to achieve modified Aldrete scores ≥ 9 in PE and SE group were obviously shortened compared with P and S group (P < 0.05); modified OAA/S and Aldrete scores at T1 and T2 in PE and SE group were significantly higher than those in P and S group (P < 0.05), and the scores of SE group at T1 were much higher compared to PE group (P < 0.05). Dose of intraoperative remifentanil in PE and SE group was significantly lower than that in P and S group. Compared to propofol intravenous general anesthesia or sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia, propofol or sevoflurane general anesthesia combined with epidural block was more conducive to increasing the awakening quality of the senile patients from anesthesia after radical gastric cancer surgery. Moreover, sevofluorane inhalation general anesthesia combined with epidural block achieved a more stable hemodynamics and a shortened time to awakening.","Zhang Ling, Chen Chen, Wang Lin, Cheng Gao, Wu Wei-Wei, Li Yuan-Hai",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,2015,26770584,PMC4694484,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26770584,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4694484,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Effect of 90° counterclockwise rotation of the endotracheal tube on its advancement through the larynx during nasal fiberoptic intubation in children: a randomized and blinded study.,"Resistance to the passage of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is frequently encountered in children as it is advanced over the fiberoptic scope for placement into the trachea because it gets hung up at the laryngeal inlet. Literature in adults indicates that a 90° counterclockwise rotation (CCR) of the ETT before advancing results in smooth passage. We found no literature in children. Our aim was to study if a 90° counterclockwise rotation (CCR) of the ETT before advancement leads to smooth passage of the ETT into the larynx in children. Following IRB approval, we performed this study in two parts: Part 1: An unblinded, observational, pilot study on 20 children scheduled for oral rehabilitation where we concurrently used a fiberoptic scope nasally and GlideScope orally. We visualized the ETT path and observed that 90° CCR allowed smooth passage without hang up. Part 2: A blinded and randomized study on 40 children to confirm if 90° CCR from the outset would improve passage of the ETT during nasal intubation with a fiberoptic scope in children. All children were divided into two groups: group S, ETT bevel facing left; group R, ETT bevel facing down. In Part 1, we observed that the ETT got hung up in 57% of children with standard bevel direction (facing left) and in 0% of children when prerotated. In Part 2, efficacy of prerotation was confirmed; the ETT got hung up in 50% of children in group S but in only 10.5% of children in group R. A change in ETT tip orientation from bevel facing left to facing down by 90° CCR, leads to a significantly higher first-attempt success rate by nasal approach in children. We believe the ETT should be rotated before insertion into the nostril to ensure that full 90° CCR of the tip has been accomplished.","Choudhry Dinesh K, Brenn B Randall, Lutwin-Kawalec Malgorzata, Sacks Karen, Nesargi Susmita, He Zhaoping",Paediatric anaesthesia,2016,26749187,,10.1111/pan.12836,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26749187,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Characterizing the Pain Narratives of Parents of Youth With Chronic Pain.,"Questionnaire-based research has shown that parents exert a powerful influence on and are profoundly influenced by living with a child with chronic pain. Examination of parents' pain narratives through an observational lens offers an alternative approach to understanding the complexity of pediatric chronic pain; however, the narratives of parents of youth with chronic pain have been largely overlooked. The present study aimed to characterize the vulnerability-based and resilience-based aspects of the pain narratives of parents of youth with chronic pain. Pain narratives of 46 parents were recorded during the baseline session as part of 2 clinical trials evaluating a behavioral intervention for parents of youth with chronic pain. The narratives were coded for aspects of pain-related vulnerability and resilience. Using exploratory cluster analysis, 2 styles of parents' pain narratives were identified. Distress narratives were characterized by more negative affect and an exclusively unresolved orientation toward the child's diagnosis of chronic pain, whereas resilience narratives were characterized by positive affect and a predominantly resolved orientation toward the child's diagnosis. Preliminary support for the validity of these clusters was provided through our finding of differences between clusters in parental pain catastrophizing about child pain (helplessness). Findings highlight the multidimensional nature of parents' experience of their child's pain problem. Clinical implications in terms of assessment and treatment are discussed.","Noel Melanie, Beals-Erickson Sarah E, Law Emily F, Alberts Nicole M, Palermo Tonya M",The Clinical journal of pain,2016,26736026,PMC4935638,10.1097/AJP.0000000000000346,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26736026,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935638,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Accidental administration of the remifentanil formulation Ultiva™ into the epidural space and the complete time course of its consequences: a case report.,"Ultiva™ contains the potent short-acting μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil hydrochloride, and it is commonly administered intravenously during general anesthesia. It is not approved for epidural or intrathecal use in clinical practice because it contains glycine as an acidic buffer. However, at this moment, very limited information is available on epidural administration of Ultiva™. We report the accidental administration of 300 μg of remifentanil and 2.25 mg of glycine into the epidural space after emergence from general anesthesia for distal pancreatectomy and the complete time course of its consequences. The respiratory depression occurred at 5 min after the administration, and complete loss of consciousness was observed at 8 min. The patient was re-intubated and underwent mechanical respiration. At 45 min (33 min after re-intubation), spontaneous respiration resumed, she was responsive to commands, and her orientation returned. She was extubated successfully. These consequences might have resulted from the diffusion of the components of Ultiva™ into not only systemic circulation but also the cerebrospinal fluid.

The Cognitive Science of Learning: Concepts and Strategies for the Educator and Learner.,"Education is the fundamental process used to develop and maintain the professional skills of physicians. Medical students, residents, and fellows are expected to learn considerable amounts of information as they progress toward board certification. Established practitioners must continue to learn in an effort to remain up-to-date in their clinical realm. Those responsible for educating these populations endeavor to teach in a manner that is effective, efficient, and durable. The study of learning and performance is a subdivision of the field of cognitive science that focuses on how people interpret and process information and how they eventually develop mastery. A deeper understanding of how individuals learn can empower both educators and learners to be more effective in their endeavors. In this article, we review a number of concepts found in the literature on learning and performance. We address both the theoretical principles and the practical applications of each concept. Cognitive load theory, constructivism, and analogical transfer are concepts particularly beneficial to educators. An understanding of goal orientation, metacognition, retrieval, spaced learning, and deliberate practice will primarily benefit the learner. When these concepts are understood and incorporated into education and study, the effectiveness of learning is significantly improved.","Weidman Joseph, Baker Keith",Anesthesia and analgesia,2015,26579660,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000000890,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26579660,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Desflurane Allows for a Faster Emergence When Compared to Sevoflurane without Affecting the Baseline Cognitive Recovery Time.,"We compared the effect of desflurane and sevoflurane on anesthesia recovery time in patients undergoing urological cystoscopic surgery. The Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test (SOMCT) measured and compared cognitive impairment between groups and coughing was assessed throughout the anesthetic. This investigation included 75 ambulatory patients. Patients were randomized to receive either desflurane or sevoflurane. Inhalational anesthetics were discontinued after removal of the cystoscope and once repositioning of the patient was final. Coughing assessment and awakening time from anesthesia were assessed by a blinded observer. Statistical analysis was performed by using t-test for parametric variables and Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric variables. The primary endpoint, mean time to eye-opening, was 5.0 ± 2.5 min for desflurane and 7.9 ± 4.1 min for sevoflurane (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in time to SOMCT recovery (p = 0.109), overall time spent in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (p = 0.924) or time to discharge (p = 0.363). Median time until readiness for discharge was 9 min in the desflurane group, while the sevoflurane group had a median time of 20 min (p = 0.020). The overall incidence of coughing during the perioperative period was significantly higher in the desflurane (p = 0.030). We re-confirmed that patients receiving desflurane had a faster emergence and met the criteria to be discharged from the PACU earlier. No difference was found in time to return to baseline cognition between desflurane and sevoflurane.","Werner Joseph G, Castellon-Larios Karina, Thongrong Cattleya, Knudsen Bodo E, Lowery Deborah S, Antor Maria A, Bergese Sergio Daniel",Frontiers in medicine,2015,26579522,PMC4623413,10.3389/fmed.2015.00075,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26579522,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623413,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Effects of changing from sevoflurane to desflurane on the recovery profile after sevoflurane induction: a randomized controlled study.,"Desflurane has the lowest solubility of currently available volatile anesthetics and may allow for more rapid emergence and recovery compared with sevoflurane. Nevertheless, after volatile induction with sevoflurane, it has not been determined whether the use of desflurane provides faster emergence and recovery. The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of changing from sevoflurane to desflurane during the early part of anesthesia. Fifty-two patients who were scheduled for vitreous surgery with general anesthesia were enrolled in this randomized controlled study. Anesthesia was induced with volatile induction consisting of 100% oxygen (6 L·min(-1)) and 5% sevoflurane. For anesthesia maintenance, patients were randomized to receive 1-2% sevoflurane or 3-6% desflurane. In the desflurane group, the anesthetic agent was changed from sevoflurane to desflurane within five minutes following endotracheal intubation. After surgery, we assessed the following endpoints: the times from discontinuing volatile anesthetics to eye opening, obeying the command to squeeze the investigator's hand, tracheal extubation, and orientation to the patients' full name, date, and place. Emergence and recovery were significantly faster in the desflurane group than in the sevoflurane group in times to mean (SD) eye opening [6.5 (2.9) vs 10.1(3.0) min, respectively; mean difference, 3.6 min; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.9 to 5.3; P < 0.001], obeying commands [6.6 (2.7) vs 10.1 (3.1) min, respectively; mean difference, 3.5 min; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.2; P < 0.001], and tracheal extubation [7.0 (2.5) vs 10.6 (3.0) min, respectively; mean difference, 3.6 min; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.1; P < 0.001]. Similarly, the times from discontinuation of volatile anesthetics to orientation to the patients' full name, date, and place were significantly shorter in the desflurane group compared with the sevoflurane group. There were no significant differences between groups on a 100-mm visual analogue scale assessing postoperative nausea and vomiting, eye pain, and patient satisfaction regarding anesthesia. Changing the anesthetic agent from sevoflurane to desflurane after sevoflurane induction provides faster emergence and recovery compared with sevoflurane anesthesia.

The impact of blood pressure cuff location on the accuracy of noninvasive blood pressure measurements in obese patients: an observational study.,"Obesity presents many challenges to the anesthesiologist, including poorly fitting blood pressure (BP) cuffs due to the conical shape of the upper arm. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive BP readings, obtained from a noninvasive BP cuff using various cuff locations and wrapping techniques, compared with invasive intra-arterial BP readings. Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III obese (body mass index > 30 kg·m(-2)) individuals undergoing non-cardiac surgery were enrolled in this observational study. Serial oscillometric noninvasive BP (NIBP) measurements were taken in the patients' forearm and upper arm with two different wrapping formations (one following the contour of the upper arm, the other keeping cuff edges parallel). These NIBP measurements were compared with invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) measurements taken from the ipsilateral radial artery. The precision and bias of the NIBP and ABP measurements were determined using Bland-Altman analysis. Analysis of variance and Welch's t test were used to determine between-group differences in bias. There was poor agreement between the ABP measurements and all types of NIBP measurements. Each of our study participants had a least one NIBP parameter (mean arterial pressure, systolic BP, or diastolic BP) that was > 10 mmHg different than the corresponding ABP parameter. Upper arm BP measurements showed a statistically insignificant trend toward underestimating ABP. For all cuff positions and wrapping techniques, systolic BP offered the best agreement between NIBP and ABP measurements. All the forms of NIBP cuff orientation studied had unacceptable precision and bias compared with invasive ABP measurements. When patient and/or surgical conditions necessitate accurate BP monitoring, direct arterial measurement should be considered over NIBP measurements in obese patients.","Anast Nicholas, Olejniczak Megan, Ingrande Jerry, Brock-Utne John",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2016,26475165,,10.1007/s12630-015-0509-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26475165,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,

Current State of Institutional Privileging Profiles for Pediatric Procedural Sedation Providers.,"Providers from a variety of training backgrounds and specialties provide procedural sedation at institutions in the United States. We sought to better understand the privileging patterns and practices for sedation providers. Surveys were sent to 56 program directors belonging to the Society for Pediatric Sedation using Research Electronic Data Capture to 56 pediatric sedation programs. The survey was designed to gather information regarding characteristics of their sedation service and the privileging of their sedation providers. The overall response rate was 41 (73%) of 56. Most programs surveyed (81%) said their physicians provided sedation as a part of their primary subspecialty job description, and 17% had physicians whose sole practice was pediatric sedation and no longer practiced in their primary subspecialty. Fifty-one percent of surveyed sedation programs were within freestanding children's hospitals and 61% receive oversight by the anesthesiology department at their institution. Eighty-one percent of the sedation programs require physicians to undergo special credentialing to provide sedation. Of these, 79% grant privileging through their primary specialty, whereas 39% require separate credentialing through sedation as a stand-alone section. For initial credentialing, requirements included completion of a pediatric sedation orientation and training packet (51% of programs), sedation training during fellowship (59%), and documentation of a specific number of pediatric procedural sedation cases (49%). In this survey of pediatric sedation programs belonging to the Society for Pediatric Sedation, the process for privileging providers in procedural sedation varies significantly from institution to institution.

The Feasibility of Simultaneous Orthogonal Plane Imaging with Tilt for Short-Axis Evaluation of the Pulmonic Valve by Transesophageal Echocardiography.,"Simultaneous orthogonal plane imaging with tilt enables the display of two 2D, real-time images and the evaluation of structures that cannot be seen by conventional single-plane transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) imaging. After a step-wise examination protocol, we used simultaneous orthogonal plane imaging to obtain the short-axis view of the pulmonic valve (PV) and assessed flow in both images simultaneously using color Doppler imaging in 100 consecutive patients undergoing intraoperative TEE. Our goals were to assess the ability of this technique to visualize all 3 leaflets of the PV, assess feasibility of planimetry to measure valve area, and assess flow using color Doppler imaging. All study images were obtained by anesthesiologists who are diplomates in Advanced Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography. All 3 leaflets of the PV were successfully visualized in the short-axis view in 65% of cases, 2 leaflets were visualized in 32% of cases, and only 1 leaflet could be imaged in 3%. The flow across the valve could be evaluated using color Doppler imaging in all cases. Planimetry for valve area was possible when all 3 leaflets were seen. It is important to inspect the PV during a routine TEE examination; however, the orientation of the PV in respect to the esophagus makes this evaluation challenging. We present a simple protocol to evaluate the PV in long-axis and short-axis views simultaneously that can potentially help evaluate for pathologies involving the PV.","Dwarakanath Sanjay, Castresana Manuel R, Behr Amanda Y, Arthur Mary E",Anesthesia and analgesia,2015,26287295,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000000828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26287295,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Xenon Anesthesia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Xenon anesthesia has been studied for decades. However, no meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on xenon anesthesia has been conducted. The aim of this study was to systematically review all available evidence from RCTs comparing xenon and other inhaled and IV anesthetics on anesthetic outcomes. Our meta-analysis attempted to quantify the effects of xenon anesthesia on clinical outcomes in relation to other anesthetics. We found 43 RCTs from PubMed, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CINAHL (until January 2015). A total of 31 studies comparing xenon (841 patients) with other inhaled agents (836 patients) and 12 studies comparing xenon (373 patients) with propofol (360 patients) were found. We evaluated clinical outcomes, such as intraoperative hemodynamics, emergence, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Patients undergoing xenon anesthesia had a lower heart rate and higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) intraoperatively than those receiving volatile anesthesia (mean difference = -6 min⁻¹ [99% confidence interval {99% CI} -10.0 to -2.3]; mean difference = 9 mm Hg [99% CI 3.1-14.4]) and propofol anesthesia (mean difference = -10 min⁻¹ [99% CI -12.4 to -6.6]; mean difference = 7 mm Hg [99% CI 0.85-13.2]). Compared with baseline, intraoperative MAP remained relatively stable (change < 5.5%, 99% CI within ±20% of the baseline) under xenon anesthesia, but MAP decreased by ≥15% under volatile (mean difference = -17 mm Hg [99% CI -29.5 to - 4.9], percentage change = -17.5%) and propofol (mean difference = -14 mm Hg [99% CI -26.1 to -2.5], percentage change = -15.0%) anesthesia. Patients had faster emergence from xenon than from volatile anesthesia: eyes opening (versus all volatile agents: mean 4 vs 7 minutes, percentage change = -49.8% [99% CI -55.1% to -44.0%]), tracheal extubation (versus all volatile agents: mean 4 vs 8 minutes percentage change = -44.6% [99% CI -57.3% to -28.1%]), orientation (versus sevoflurane: mean 5 vs 10 minutes, percentage change = -45.1% [99% CI -58.5% to -28.1%]), countdown (versus sevoflurane: mean 6 vs 10 minutes, percentage change = -41.7% [99% CI -50.3% to -31.6%]; versus isoflurane: mean 6 vs 14 minutes, percentage change = -57.7% [99% CI -65.7% to -48.3%]), and reaction on demand (versus sevoflurane: mean 4 vs 8 minutes, percentage change = -53.2% [99% CI -65.7% to -35.6%]). However, xenon anesthesia increased the risks of PONV (incidence 34.4% vs 19.9%; risk ratio = 1.72 [99% CI 1.10-2.69], risk difference = 0.19 [99% CI 0.04-0.33]). Xenon anesthesia provides relatively more stable intraoperative blood pressure, lower heart rate, and faster emergence from anesthesia than volatile and propofol anesthesia. However, xenon is associated with a higher incidence of PONV.","Law Lawrence Siu-Chun, Lo Elaine Ah-Gi, Gan Tong Joo",Anesthesia and analgesia,2016,26273750,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000000914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26273750,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Research in surgery and anesthesia: challenges for post-graduate trainees in Uganda.,"Research is critical to the training and practice of surgery and anesthesia in all settings, regardless of available resources. Unfortunately, the output of surgical and perioperative research from Africa is low. Makerere University College of Health Sciences' (MakCHS) surgical and anesthesia trainees are required to conduct research, though few publish findings or go on to pursue careers that incorporate research. We believe that early career experiences with research may greatly influence physicians' future conduct and utilization of research. We therefore sought to analyze trainee experiences and perceptions of research to identify interventions that could increase production of high-quality, locally led, surgical disease research in our resource-constrained setting. Following ethical approval, a descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted among anesthesia and surgery trainees using a pretested, self-administered questionnaire. Data were tabulated and frequency tables generated. Of the 43 eligible trainees, 33 (77%) responded. Ninety-four percent identify research as important to career development, and 85% intend to publish their dissertations. The research dissertation is considered a financial burden by 64%. Also, 49% reported that their departments place low value on their research, and few of the findings are utilized. Trainees report that lack of protected research time, difficulty in finding research topics, and inadequate mentorship are the main challenges to conducting research projects. Our anesthesia and surgery trainees spend considerable resources on research endeavors.

"A Bolus and Bolus Followed by Infusion Study of AZD3043, an Investigational Intravenous Drug for Sedation and Anesthesia: Safety and Pharmacodynamics in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers.","AZD3043 (THRX-918661) is an investigational phenylpropanoid sedative/anesthetic that is rapidly metabolized by esterases in blood and liver. In the first-in-man study, a 30-minute constant IV infusion of AZD3043 induced anesthesia without major safety or tolerability concerns and with rapid recovery characteristics. The primary objective of this phase 1, single-center, open-label study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00984880) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD3043 administered as a single IV bolus and as a bolus followed by infusion. Secondary objectives included evaluation of AZD3043 pharmacodynamics and efficacy. Sequential ascending dose cohorts of 8 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65 years received either a single 1-minute bolus IV infusion (part A) or a 1-minute bolus followed by a 30-minute infusion (part B). Assessments included adverse events, vital signs, blood gases, laboratory values, clinical signs of sedation/anesthesia, and bispectral index score. Seventy-two subjects (8 females, 64 males) received AZD3043 doses of 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 mg/kg bolus over 1 minute (part A) or 0.8 + 10, 1 + 15, 3 + 30, and 4 + 40 mg/kg bolus + mg/kg/h infusion for 30 minutes (part B). There were no discontinuations. Adverse events occurring in >1 subject were headache (n = 15; 21%), nausea (n = 7; 10%), vomiting (n = 3; 4%), and fatigue (n = 2; 3%). Twenty-one subjects experienced at least 1 adverse event. There seemed to be no dose relationship associated with any adverse event. Ventilation was maintained, but there was a dose-dependent increase in heart rate. There were no spontaneous reports of pain on injection. Thirty-two subjects were anesthetized, including all subjects in the highest dose group in part A and all subjects in the 2 highest dose groups in part B. Recovery from anesthesia was rapid, with swift return of orientation and proprioception. All subjects were able to walk 10 m without support at their first assessment, 30 minutes after end of dosing, except for 1 subject in each of the 2 mg/kg bolus (part A) and 4 mg/kg bolus + 40 mg/kg/h 30-minute infusion (part B) dose groups, who passed this test at the subsequent assessment, 45 minutes after the end of dosing. Involuntary movements were observed at higher doses, accompanied by increased muscle tone. AZD3043 provided rapid recovery from anesthesia with maintained ventilation. Further studies are warranted in a clinical setting.","Norberg Åke, Koch Pauline, Kanes Stephen J, Björnsson Marcus A, Barassin Stéphane, Ahlén Kjell, Kalman Sigridur",Anesthesia and analgesia,2015,26097986,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000000804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26097986,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
A survey of mentorship among Canadian anesthesiology residents.,"Mentorship in medicine is associated with increased career satisfaction and personal development. Despite these benefits, little is known about mentorship in anesthesiology training programs. Our objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of formal mentorship programs among anesthesiology training programs in Canada, (2) the prevalence of informal and formal mentorship among anesthesiology residents in Canada, and (3) the predictors of having an identified mentor among anesthesiology residents in Canada. We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey of residents and program directors from Canadian anesthesiology residency programs. Program directors were questioned about formal mentorship programs, and residents were asked to provide demographic data and information about their mentorship relationships. We analyzed the relationship between resident characteristics and mentorship. Our survey response rates were 76% and 39% for the Program Director Survey and the Resident Survey, respectively. Formal mentorship programs were present in 54% of residency training programs, and 94% of residents agreed that mentorship was important. Seventy-four percent of residents identified at least one mentor, although 42% of these residents did not interact regularly with their mentor. Mentors and mentees were more likely to be of the same gender. If a formal mentorship program was present, residents were more likely to identify a mentor (82 vs 17%) and interact regularly with their mentor (70 vs 46%). Formal mentorship programs were present in half of anesthesiology training programs. Although 74% of the residents identified a mentor, 42% did not interact regularly with their mentor. The presence of a formal mentorship program was positively associated with mentorship.","Zakus Paul, Gelb Adrian W, Flexman Alana M",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2015,26087911,,10.1007/s12630-015-0418-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26087911,,TRUE,formal mentorship programs in anesthesiology training programs,anesthesiology residents in Canada,increased likelihood of residents identifying a mentor and interacting regularly with their mentor,TRUE,Formal mentorship programs,Residents and program directors from Canadian anesthesiology residency programs,"Increased career satisfaction and personal development, more likely to identify a mentor and interact regularly with their mentor"
A more pessimistic life orientation is associated with experimental inducibility of a neuropathy-like pain pattern in healthy individuals.,"The clinical pattern of neuropathic pain, diagnosed using the quantitative sensory testing (QST) battery (German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain), could be partly mimicked in healthy volunteers after topical capsaicin application. However, similar to clinical neuropathic pain that develops in only a subgroup of patients who have a neurologic lesion, this attempt to mimick a neuropathic pain pattern succeeded only in a small fraction (18%) of healthy individuals. In the present assessment, we pursued the hypothesis that the inducible subgroup differed from the other healthy participants with respect to their psychological phenotype. Therefore, in an observational study, participants were assessed using a comprehensive set of psychological variables comprising general psychological and pain-related cognitive-emotional mechanisms. The sum scores of the questionnaires were significantly linearly correlated with each other. Principal component analysis indicated that a major source of variance (46%) could be attributed to dispositional optimism examined via the Life Orientation Test (LOT). The LOT score significantly differed between the groups of participants, either those in whom a neuropathy-like pattern of pain assessed via QST could be partly (50-60% of the 11 QST parameters) induced (n = 20) or not (n = 90; P = .0375). It emerged again as the main selection criterion in a classification and regression tree predicting a participant's group assignment (inducible neuropathy-like QST pattern versus noninducible neuropathy-like QST pattern) at a cross-validated accuracy of 95.5 ± 2.1%. Thus, the few participants in a random sample of healthy volunteers who, after topical capsaicin application, partly resemble (to a degree of about 60%) the clinical pattern of neuropathic pain in the QST test battery, are preselectable on the basis of psychological factors, with a particular emphasis on pessimistic life attitudes. In a small fraction of 18% of healthy volunteers, topical capsaicin application resulted in a neuropathy-like pattern in 50 to 60% of the components of a clinical test battery. These individuals displayed a more pessimistic life attitude as assessed by means of the LOT.","Dimova Violeta, Oertel Bruno G, Kabakci Gülden, Zimmermann Michael, Hermens Hanneke, Lautenbacher Stefan, Ultsch Alfred, Lötsch Jörn",The journal of pain,2015,26056011,,10.1016/j.jpain.2015.05.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056011,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Regulation of Nav1.7: A Conserved SCN9A Natural Antisense Transcript Expressed in Dorsal Root Ganglia.,"The Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel, encoded by SCN9A, is critical for human pain perception yet the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate this gene are still incompletely understood. Here, we describe a novel natural antisense transcript (NAT) for SCN9A that is conserved in humans and mice. The NAT has a similar tissue expression pattern to the sense gene and is alternatively spliced within dorsal root ganglia. The human and mouse NATs exist in cis with the sense gene in a tail-to-tail orientation and both share sequences that are complementary to the terminal exon of SCN9A/Scn9a. Overexpression analyses of the human NAT in human embryonic kidney (HEK293A) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines show that it can function to downregulate Nav1.7 mRNA, protein levels and currents. The NAT may play an important role in regulating human pain thresholds and is a potential candidate gene for individuals with chronic pain disorders that map to the SCN9A locus, such as Inherited Primary Erythromelalgia, Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disorder and Painful Small Fibre Neuropathy, but who do not contain mutations in the sense gene. Our results strongly suggest the SCN9A NAT as a prime candidate for new therapies based upon augmentation of existing antisense RNAs in the treatment of chronic pain conditions in man.","Koenig Jennifer, Werdehausen Robert, Linley John E, Habib Abdella M, Vernon Jeffrey, Lolignier Stephane, Eijkelkamp Niels, Zhao Jing, Okorokov Andrei L, Woods C Geoffrey, Wood John N, Cox James J",PloS one,2015,26035178,PMC4452699,10.1371/journal.pone.0128830,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26035178,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4452699,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Practicality of using galvanic skin response to measure intraoperative physiologic autonomic activation in operating room team members.,"Physiologic and psychological stress are commonly experienced by operating room (OR) personnel, yet there is little research about the stress levels in OR teams and their impact on performance. Previously published procedures to measure physiologic activation are invasive and impractical for the OR. The purpose of this study was to determine the practicality of a new watch-sized device to measure galvanic skin response (GSR) in OR team members during high-fidelity surgical simulations. Interprofessional OR teams wore sensors on the wrist (all) and ankle (surgeons and scrub nurses/technicians) during the orientation, case, and debriefing phases for 17 simulations of a surgical airway case. Data were compared across all simulation phases, collectively and for each professional group. Forty anesthesiology residents, 35 surgery residents, 27 OR nurses, 12 surgical technicians, and 7 CRNAs participated. Collectively, mean wrist GSR levels significantly increased from orientation phase to the case (0.40-0.62 μS; P < .001) and remained elevated even after the simulation was over (0.40-0.67 μS; P < .001). Surgery residents were the only group that demonstrated continued increases in wrist GSR levels throughout the entire simulation (change in GSR = 0.21 to 0.32 to 0.11 μS; P < .01). Large intraindividual differences (≤ 200 times) were found in both wrist and ankle GSR. There was no correlation between wrist and ankle data. Continuous GSR monitoring of all professionals during OR simulations is feasible, but would be difficult to implement in an actual OR environment. Large variation in individual levels of physiologic activation suggests complementary qualitative research is needed to better understand how people respond to stressful OR situations.","Phitayakorn Roy, Minehart R D, Pian-Smith M C M, Hemingway M W, Petrusa E R",Surgery,2015,26032820,,10.1016/j.surg.2015.04.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26032820,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Diversity of United States medical students by region compared to US census data.,"Increasing the diversity of the United States (US) physician workforce to better represent the general population has received considerable attention. The purpose of this study was to compare medical student race data to that of the US general population. We hypothesized that race demographics of medical school matriculants would reflect that of the general population. Published race data from the United States Census Bureau (USCB) 2010 census and the 2011 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) allopathic medical school application and enrollment by race and ethnicity survey were analyzed and compared. Race data of enrolled medical students was compared to race data of the general population within geographic regions and subregions. Additionally, race data of medical school applicants and matriculants were compared to race data of the overall general population. Race distribution within US medical schools was significantly different than race distribution for the overall, regional, and subregional populations of the US (P<0.001). Additionally, the overall race distribution of medical school applicants differed significantly to the race distribution of the general population (P<0.001). This study demonstrated that race demographics of US medical school applicants and matriculants are significantly different from that of the general population, and may be resultant of societal quandaries present early in formal education. Initiatives targeting underrepresented minorities at an early stage to enhance health care career interest and provide academic support and mentorship will be required to address the racial disparity that exists in US medical schools and ultimately the physician workforce.","Smith Mark M, Rose Steven H, Schroeder Darrell R, Long Timothy R",Advances in medical education and practice,2015,26028982,PMC4440421,10.2147/AMEP.S82645,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26028982,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4440421,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Cognitive screening among acute respiratory failure survivors: a cross-sectional evaluation of the Mini-Mental State Examination.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a common cognitive screening test, but its utility in identifying impairments in survivors of acute respiratory failure is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate MMSE performance versus a concurrently administered detailed neuropsychological test battery in survivors of acute respiratory failure. This cross-sectional analysis used data from the ARDSNet Long Term Outcomes Study (ALTOS) and Awakening and Breathing Controlled Trial (ABC). Participants were 242 survivors of acute respiratory failure. The MMSE and detailed neuropsychological tests were administered at 6 and 12 months post-hospital discharge for the ALTOS study, and at hospital discharge, 3 and 12 months for the ABC study. Overall cognitive impairment identified by the MMSE (score <24) was compared to impairments identified by the neuropsychological tests. We also matched orientation, registration, attention, memory and language domains on the MMSE to the corresponding neuropsychological test. Pairwise correlations, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and agreement were assessed. Agreement between MMSE and neuropsychological tests for overall cognitive impairment was fair (42 to 80%). Specificity was excellent (≥93%), but sensitivity was poor (19 to 37%). Correlations between MMSE domains and corresponding neuropsychological tests were weak to moderate (6 months: r = 0.11 to 0.28; 12 months: r = 0.09 to 0.34). The highest correlation between the MMSE and neuropsychological domains was for attention at 6 months (r = 0.28) and language at 12 months (r = 0.34). In acute respiratory failure survivors, the MMSE has poor sensitivity in detecting cognitive impairment compared with concurrently administered detailed neuropsychological tests. MMSE results in this population should be interpreted with caution.","Pfoh Elizabeth R, Chan Kitty S, Dinglas Victor D, Girard Timothy D, Jackson James C, Morris Peter E, Hough Catherine L, Mendez-Tellez Pedro A, Ely E Wesley, Huang Minxuan, Needham Dale M, Hopkins Ramona O","Critical care (London, England)",2015,25939482,PMC4480909,10.1186/s13054-015-0934-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25939482,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480909,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Pencil-point needle bevel direction influences ED50 of isobaric ropivacaine with fentanyl in spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery: a prospective, double-blind sequential allocation study.","There is little evidence on the influence of bevel direction of a pencil-point needle on the median effective dose (ED50) of isobaric ropivacaine and fentanyl in spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. In this prospective, double-blind, sequential allocation study, 82 parturients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia were included. We sought to determine the median effective dose of intrathecal 0.75% isobaric ropivacaine plus fentanyl 15μg with two different bevel directions of a 26-gauge Whitacre needle using up-down sequential allocation. Parturients were randomly allocated to either Group Ce (needle aperture oriented in a cephalad direction) or Group Ca (aperture directed caudally). The initial dose was 0.75% ropivacaine 11.25mg plus fentanyl 15μg in both groups. Each dose was classified as effective if, after 15min and during the next 60min, there was inability to appreciate pin-prick as sharp at T4, a visual analogue pain score <2 and no requirement for an epidural rescue bolus. Eighty patients were included in the analysis. The ED50 in group Ca was significantly higher (13.09mg, 95% CI 12.19-14.00) than in group Ce (10.10mg, 95% CI 9.54-10.65, P <0.001).

"Briefing and debriefing during simulation-based training and beyond: Content, structure, attitude and setting.","In this article, we review the debriefing literature and point to the dilemma that although debriefings especially intend to enhance team (rather than individual) learning, it is particularly this team setting that poses risks for debriefing effectiveness (e.g., preference-consistent information sharing, lack of psychological safety inhibiting structured information sharing, ineffective debriefing models). These risks can be managed with a mindful approach with respect to content (e.g., specific learning objectives), structure (e.g., reactions phase, analysis phase, summary phase), attitude (e.g., honesty, curiosity, holding the trainee in positive regard) and setting (e.g., briefings to provide orientation and establish psychological safety). We point to the potential of integrating systemic methods such as circular questions into debriefings, discuss the empirical evidence for debriefing effectiveness and highlight the importance of faculty development.","Kolbe Michaela, Grande Bastian, Spahn Donat R",Best practice & research.

The optimal anesthetic depth for interventional neuroradiology: comparisons between light anesthesia and deep anesthesia.,"This study was designed to determine the optimal anesthetic depth for the maintenance and recovery in interventional neuroradiology. Eighty-eight patients undergoing interventional neuroradiology were randomly allocated to light anesthesia (n = 44) or deep anesthesia (n = 44) groups based on the value of the bispectral index (BIS). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, alfentanil, and rocuronium and maintained with 1-3% sevoflurane. The concentration of sevoflurane was titrated to maintain BIS at 40-49 (deep anesthesia group) or 50-59 (light anesthesia group). Phenylephrine was used to maintain the mean arterial pressure within 20% of preinduction values. Recovery times were recorded. The light anesthesia group had a more rapid recovery to spontaneous ventilation, eye opening, extubation, and orientation (4.1 ± 2.3 vs. 5.3 ± 1.8 min, 6.9 ± 3.2 min vs. 9.1 ± 3.2 min, 8.2 ± 3.1 min vs. 10.7 ± 3.3 min, 10.0 ± 3.9 min vs. 12.9 ± 5.5 min, all P < 0.01) compared to the deep anesthesia group. The use of phenylephrine was significantly increased in the deep anesthesia group (768 ± 184 vs. 320 ± 82 µg, P < 0.01). More patients moved during the procedure in the light anesthesia group (6/44 [14%] vs. 0/44 [0%], P = 0.026). BIS values between 50 and 59 for interventional neuroradiology were associated with a more rapid recovery and favorable hemodynamic response, but also with more patient movement. We suggest that maintaining BIS values between 40 and 49 is preferable for the prevention of patient movement during anesthesia for interventional neuroradiology.","Jung Yoo Sun, Han Ye-Reum, Choi Eun-Su, Kim Byung-Gun, Park Hee-Pyoung, Hwang Jung-Won, Jeon Young-Tae",Korean journal of anesthesiology,2015,25844133,PMC4384402,10.4097/kjae.2015.68.2.148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25844133,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4384402,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
"Comparison of intraoperative brain condition, hemodynamics and postoperative recovery between desflurane and sevoflurane in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy.","Post operative recovery has been reported to be faster with desflurane than sevoflurane anesthesia in previous studies. The use of desflurane is often criticized in neurosurgery due to the concerns of cerebral vasodilation and increase in ICP and studies comparing desflurane and sevoflurane in neurosurgey are scarce. So we compared the intraoperative brain condition, hemodynamics and postoperative recovery in patients undergoing elective supratentorial craniotomy receiving either desflurane or sevoflurane. Fifty three patients between 18-60yr undergoing elective supratentorial craniotomy receiving N2O and oxygen (60%:40%) and 0.8-1.2 MAC of either desflurane or sevoflurane were randomized to group S (Sevoflurane) or group D (Desflurane). Subdural intra cranial pressure (ICP) was measured and brain condition was assessed.. Emergence time, tracheal extubation time and recovery time were recorded. Cognitive behavior was evaluated with Short Orientation Memory Concentration Test (SOMCT) and neurological outcome (at the time of discharge) was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) between the two groups. The emergence time [Group D 7.4 ± 2.7 minutes vs. Group S 7.8 ± 3.7 minutes; P = 0.65], extubation time [Group D 11.8 ± 2.8 minutes vs. Group S 12.9 ± 4.9 minutes; P = 0.28] and recovery time [Group D 16.4 ± 2.6 minutes vs. Group S 17.1 ± 4.8 minutes; P = 0.50] were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in ICP [Group D; 9.1 ± 4.3 mmHg vs. Group S; 10.9 ± 4.2 mmHg; P = 0.14] and brain condition between the two groups.

Dezocine for anesthesia and stress reduction in induced abortion.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dezocine with regard to analgesic and stress reduction outcomes in women undergoing induced abortion. A total of 126 women in early pregnancy (up to 14 weeks' gestation) who underwent induced abortion at Cangzhou Central Hospital from May 2012 to May 2013 were randomly assigned to a control (propofol) group (n=63) or an intervention (propofol + dezocine) group (n=63). Wake-up time, orientation force recovery time, incidence of adverse reactions, postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score, analgesic effect, and respiratory and circulatory monitoring before the operation, 5 minutes into the operation, and 5 minutes after the operation were compared between the two groups. The surgical procedure and anesthesia were performed successfully in all patients. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and oxyhemoglobin saturation in the intervention group were significantly higher than in the control group; however, heart rate was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group 5 minutes into the operation (all P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in these parameters before surgery and after recovery. The postoperative VAS score (2.82±0.72), Ramsay score (2.65±0.65), and anesthetic effect in the intervention group were better than in the control group (3.90±0.84 and 2.21±0.49, respectively), and all differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The wake-up time (3.41±0.79 minutes) and orientation force recovery time (4.28±0.92 minutes) were all significantly shorter (P<0.05) in the intervention group than in the control group, as was the incidence of adverse reactions (7.94% versus 26.98%, respectively).

Residents' scholarly activity: a cost analysis with regard to its effects on departments.,"Current financial strain on training departments may have a significantly negative impact on continuing support for residents' scholarly activity. A cost analysis with regard to residents' scholarly activity effects on anesthesiology training departments is performed. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has issued a new outcome-focused scholarly activity requirement. Low scholarly achievement by anesthesiology faculty in the USA has been documented and needs transformation. It is evident that a structured scholarly activity support system is effective. To support such a system, training departments need to support anesthesiology residents' nonclinical time, which would cost an average of $13,500 per month per resident using nonresident hands-on care providers in operating rooms, resident's meeting attendance in average $1,424 per resident per meeting, and faculty mentorship and other infrastructure. It must also be taken into account that missed clinical opportunities by an anesthesiology resident during nonclinical time are an estimated average of 60 cases per month. The importance of resident scholarly activity has never been so or as critical as in the present. Anesthesiology leadership must continue to invest to support resident scholarly activity for the future of the specialty while being mindful of costs incurred.",Sakai Tetsuro,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2015,25602840,,10.1097/ACO.0000000000000162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602840,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Upright face-preferential high-gamma responses in lower-order visual areas: evidence from intracranial recordings in children.,"Behavioral studies demonstrate that a face presented in the upright orientation attracts attention more rapidly than an inverted face. Saccades toward an upright face take place in 100-140 ms following presentation. The present study using electrocorticography determined whether upright face-preferential neural activation, as reflected by augmentation of high-gamma activity at 80-150 Hz, involved the lower-order visual cortex within the first 100 ms post-stimulus presentation. Sampled lower-order visual areas were verified by the induction of phosphenes upon electrical stimulation. These areas resided in the lateral-occipital, lingual, and cuneus gyri along the calcarine sulcus, roughly corresponding to V1 and V2. Measurement of high-gamma augmentation during central (circular) and peripheral (annular) checkerboard reversal pattern stimulation indicated that central-field stimuli were processed by the more polar surface whereas peripheral-field stimuli by the more anterior medial surface. Upright face stimuli, compared to inverted ones, elicited up to 23% larger augmentation of high-gamma activity in the lower-order visual regions at 40-90 ms. Upright face-preferential high-gamma augmentation was more highly correlated with high-gamma augmentation for central than peripheral stimuli. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that lower-order visual regions, especially those for the central field, are involved in visual cues for rapid detection of upright face stimuli.","Matsuzaki Naoyuki, Schwarzlose Rebecca F, Nishida Masaaki, Ofen Noa, Asano Eishi",NeuroImage,2015,25579446,PMC4340724,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.01.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25579446,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340724,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Intraoperative target-controlled infusion anesthesia application using remifentanil hydrochloride with etomidate in patients with severe burn as monitored using Narcotrend.,"This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of intraoperative composite target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia application using remifentanil hydrochloride with etomidate in patients with severe burns, as monitored by Narcotrend. A total of 40 patients with severe burns with eschar excisions and skin grafts were randomly and equally grouped into the etomidate (E) and the propofol groups (P). Anesthesia was induced and maintained by a remifentanil hydrochloride TCI combined with etomidate or propofol. The depth of anesthesia and other relevant indicators were recorded through intraoperative electroencephalogram monitoring using a Narcotrend monitor. No statistically significant differences were observed between the drug withdrawal times, eye opening requirements, or orientation recoveries of the two groups (P>0.05). The cortisol and aldosterone levels in group E were significantly lower than those in group P 24h post operation (P<0.05). No significant differences between the number of operations, hospitalization duration, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and postoperative adverse reaction incidence of the two groups were observed at each time point (P>0.05). The application of a composite remifentanil hydrochloride combined with etomidate TCI is feasible for the early eschar excision in patients with severe burns.","Guo Zhenggang, Pang Liwei, Jia Xiaopeng, Wang Xiaoyan, Su Xiaojun, Li Ping, Mi Weidong, Hao Jianhua",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2015,24931823,,10.1016/j.burns.2014.04.021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24931823,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
Evident cognitive impairments in seemingly recovered patients after midazolam-based light sedation during diagnostic endoscopy.,"Midazolam is a widely used sedative agent during colonoscopy, with cognitive toxicity. However, the potential cognitive hazard of midazolam-based light sedation has not been sufficiently examined. We aimed to examine the cognitive safety and vulnerability profile under midazolam light sedation, with a particular focus on individual variations. We conducted a prospective case-controlled study in an academic hospital. In total, 30 patients undergoing sedative colonoscopy as part of a health check-up were recruited. Neuropsychological testing on the full cognitive spectrum was evaluated at 15 minutes and 120 minutes after low-dose midazolam administration. The modified reliable change index (RCI) was used for intrapersonal comparisons and controlling for practice effects. Midazolam affected psychomotor speed (48%), memory (40%), learning (32%), working memory (17%), and sustained attention (11%), while sparing orientation and the fluency aspect of executive function at the acute stage. Residual memory (10%) and learning (10%) impairments at 2 hours after administration were evidenced in some patients. The three object recall and digit symbol coding tests can serve as useful screening tools. Midazolam-based light sedation induced selective cognitive impairments and prolonged cognitive impairments occurred in patients with advanced age. A longer observation time and further screening were recommended for patients due to their at risk state.","Hsu Yen-Hsuan, Lin Feng-Sheng, Yang Chi-Cheng, Lin Chih-Peng, Hua Mau-Sun, Sun Wei-Zen",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,2015,24035569,,10.1016/j.jfma.2013.07.018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24035569,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,,,
