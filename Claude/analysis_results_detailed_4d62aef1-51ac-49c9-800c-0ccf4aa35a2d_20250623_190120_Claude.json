    "summary": "This qualitative study explores how residents adapt to their new roles during the transition to residency (TTR) by examining both individual strategies used by residents and organizational strategies employed by healthcare institutions. Through interviews with 16 second-year residents from different specialties in the Netherlands, the researchers identified five individual strategies residents use (observing others, asking questions, experimenting, establishing social relationships, and seeking information) and six organizational strategies based on Organizational Socialization theory. A key finding is that organizational strategies can either facilitate or hinder residents' adaptation efforts, with residents differing in their perceptions of which strategies were helpful. The study highlights the dynamic interaction between individual and organizational approaches to transition, suggesting that residency programs should customize support to individual needs while balancing autonomy and guidance.",

The study collected responses from 406 anesthesiologists (111 mentees, 49 mentors, 193 both, 53 neither) regarding preferences, facilitators, and barriers to mentorship relationships. Key findings include: personal compatibility was identified as the most important factor for successful mentorship; barriers included time constraints and perceived lack of interest; women were more likely to perceive lack of interest as a barrier; and non-white mentees valued self-confidence gains from mentorship.

The authors conducted a pre-intervention survey of 11 faculty members hired between 2016-2018 to identify gaps in their onboarding experience. Based on these findings, they implemented two key improvements: (1) a standardized checklist of required onboarding elements with corresponding resources, and (2) an assigned faculty liaison ('buddy') to support new hires. The post-intervention survey of 13 faculty members hired in 2020 showed improved satisfaction scores in 10 out of 11 categories, though only one category (relocation information) reached statistical significance. The authors conclude that structured, feedback-responsive onboarding improves new hire experience and may contribute to better enculturation, retention, and organizational success.",

The authors compare outcomes between 50 patients who underwent thoracoscopic procedures and 30 who had thoracotomies.

Results showed thoracoscopic procedures had significantly shorter hospital stays (3.5 vs 7 days), shorter chest tube duration (3 vs 4 days), and fewer complications (7% vs 13%) compared to thoracotomy.

The program was designed to address knowledge gaps between academic training and pediatric clinical practice for both new graduates and experienced RTs.

The authors evaluated 92 new hires over four program iterations (2017-2020), finding significant improvements in simulation scores after orientation for both new graduates and experienced RTs. The program helped identify knowledge gaps, customize orientation, and determine readiness for ICU orientation, with 71% of participants successfully advancing to ICU orientation.",

Using constructivist grounded theory, the researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 female leaders in anesthesiology across the United States and Canada. The analysis identified four central themes: personality traits (adaptability, perseverance), leadership preparation (networking, formal training, mentorship), gender-related considerations (workplace bias, family obligations), and leadership acquisition (self-promotion, sponsorship). The study found that early-career high-value mentorship and sponsorship were crucial factors in leadership acquisition, with sponsorship being the dominant pathway for women moving into leadership roles.

The ACOR course, based on the blended SORT-IT model, was designed to teach operational research skills to acute care trainees through online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors. The study conducted semi-structured interviews with all 12 participants (6 residents, 4 primary mentors, 2 secondary mentors) to understand obstacles and improve future iterations. Results showed a 50% publication rate for enrolled students with an expected 100% acceptance rate for those completing the course. Benefits included improved research knowledge, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange. Major obstacles included time limitations, insufficient background knowledge, and communication challenges. Cultural barriers were recognized by only 4 of 12 participants. The authors conclude that research training in low-resource settings requires continued focus on mentorship and time allocation.",

Eighteen anesthesiology residents were divided into two groups: part-task training (n=9) and whole-task training (n=9).

Results showed higher success rates in the part-task group (100% vs 55.6% for Aintree catheter placement; 66.7% vs 44.4% for tracheal tube placement), suggesting that simulation-based part-task training combined with the Pecha Kucha method improves airway management training outcomes.",

Through a survey of 1,199 American Society of Anesthesiologists members, the authors found significant gaps in business education and transition to practice (TTP) preparation. Key findings include: 91% of respondents reported no formal TTP curriculum during residency; 72% had no mentor; 78% were unfamiliar with resources to help with TTP; and 59% reported their residency did not address any of the 12 ACGME-required PM topics. Those in practice \u226410 years were more likely to have received TTP training than those in practice longer, suggesting some improvement since PM became an ACGME requirement in 2008. Despite feeling clinically prepared, many respondents felt unprepared for the business aspects of practice, with 39% changing jobs within their first 5 years.",

With a 41.1% response rate, the study found that 79.7% of responding programs provided personal mentors to residents, though only 36.2% allocated protected non-clinical time for mentoring. Programs with formal mentorship were significantly more likely to have CDC programs compared to those without mentors. Larger residency programs (\u226530 residents) and university-based programs were more likely to provide lectures on specific CDC topics like contract negotiation, retirement plans, and career options. The study concluded that establishing a mentorship program may be the first step in creating a CDC, and program size was a strong predictor of CDC content.

The study found that while 79% of residents agreed mentorship was beneficial to success as an anesthesiologist, only 69% of programs had formal mentorship programs, and only 63% of residents reported access to a mentor. Key barriers identified included insufficient time with mentors, lack of formalized meeting times and objectives, mentor-mentee incompatibility, and lack of resident choice in mentor selection. The study highlights a disconnect between residents' desire for quality mentorship relationships with choice and the predominant 'top-down' mentorship model in most Canadian anesthesia residency programs.",

The researchers found that 54% of programs had formal mentorship programs, and 74% of residents identified at least one mentor, though 42% did not interact regularly with their mentor. The presence of a formal mentorship program was positively associated with residents identifying a mentor (82% vs 17%) and with regular mentor interaction. Most residents (94%) agreed mentorship was important, and 86% were satisfied with their mentorship relationships. Common mentorship topics included career planning, clinical expertise, and work-life balance. Mentors were typically male (73%), mid-level or senior faculty (71%), anesthesiologists (94%), and at the same institution (90%). Gender concordance was common, with male residents predominantly having male mentors (93%) while female residents had more gender diversity in mentors.",
