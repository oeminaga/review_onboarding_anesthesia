"The Co-Pilot Project in wartime: lessons from Lviv, Ukraine.","The ongoing war in Ukraine has introduced many challenges to an already overburdened and resource-limited medical system. Longitudinal collaborations, material support, educational outreach, and surgical mentorship are essential for improving outcomes and standards of neurosurgical care in extreme settings such as in times of war. Operating in Ukraine since 2016 through the coordination of Razom, the Co-Pilot Project has organized multiple United States-based mission trips to Ukraine to support local physicians during wartime, including a trip between April and May of 2023. A team of two anesthesiologists, two neurosurgeons, a neurointerventional radiologist, and an industry representative providing technical expertise aided in the instruction and performance of complex neurosurgical and neurovascular procedures by Ukrainian physicians at St. Panteleimon Hospital and St. Nicholas Children's Hospital in Lviv. Such efforts are crucial for helping to address the sharp rise in elective neurosurgical volume caused by the increase in internally displaced persons in Western Ukraine since February 2022. In an illustrative case, the authors provide an in-depth description of a foramen magnum meningioma resection via a far lateral craniotomy in a 48-year-old female. Despite the supply shortages and logistical challenges brought on by war, the Co-Pilot Project continues to utilize a long-term approach to continually improve the operative capabilities of Ukrainian neurosurgeons through both in-person and virtual collaborations. It is hoped that the lessons learned from a recent trip to Ukraine will help to inform and inspire other global neurosurgery initiatives in the future.","Markosian Christopher, Strelko Oleksandr, Zhang Jeff F, Kuts-Karpenko Viktoriia, Shapiro Peter, Vaskul Roksolana, Lovha Mykhailo, Flys Yuriy, Shapiro Maksim, Forbes Jonathan A, Tomycz Luke D",Neurosurgical focus,2025.0,40022743,,10.3171/2024.12.FOCUS24602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40022743,,True,"Surgical mentorship through in-person mission trips and virtual collaborations, including instruction and performance of complex neurosurgical and neurovascular procedures","Ukrainian physicians, particularly neurosurgeons, at St. Panteleimon Hospital and St. Nicholas Children's Hospital in Lviv","Improved operative capabilities of Ukrainian neurosurgeons, addressing increased elective neurosurgical volume, and improved outcomes and standards of neurosurgical care in wartime settings",True,"Longitudinal collaborations, material support, educational outreach, and surgical mentorship.

Development of an Educational Curriculum for Implanting and Managing Vagus Nerve Stimulators for Epilepsy.,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices are commonly used for extracranial neuromodulation of drug-resistant epilepsy. These devices are implanted by multiple surgical subspecialties and managed by practitioners with varying levels of epilepsy-specific expertise. The North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) education committee presents a curriculum defining level-dependent recommendations within the six-core competency rubric for the implantation and management of VNS devices. A multidisciplinary (anesthesiology, neurology, neurosurgery, and physiatrists) and diverse (advanced practice providers, physicians, and surgeons) subcommittee of the NANS education committee met virtually over a year to develop a curriculum following the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies. The subcommittee used a consensus approach, evidence-based development strategy; once completed, the VNS curriculum was approved by the NANS board. The subcommittee developed a VNS curriculum as a standard to be used for implanting surgeons, managing physicians, and advanced practice providers. The vertical orientation of the curriculum uses the ACGME educational core competencies framework; within this paradigm is a horizontal progression of skills with distinct competency groups for implanting surgeons and/or managing physicians. The horizontal progression defines the expected competence for early learner, advanced learner, and independent practitioner. A NANS education subcommittee iteratively developed a VNS curriculum for defining progressive competence of myriad care providers, including clinicians and advanced practice providers, within the ACGME six core competencies.","Bieber David, Gupta Kunal, Abdallah Rany, Abd-Elsayed Alaa, Engle Alyson, Duff Irina, Hoffman Duvan, Kalia Hemant, Rosenow Joshua, Macken Micheal, Raslan Ahmed M, Slavin Konstantin, Tennant Amy, Raskin Jeffrey S",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2025.0,39969456,,10.1016/j.neurom.2024.12.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39969456,,True,Educational curriculum for VNS devices following ACGME core competencies with horizontal progression of skills for different competency levels,"Implanting surgeons, managing physicians, and advanced practice providers including anesthesiologists","Progressive competence in implanting and managing VNS devices for epilepsy across early learners, advanced learners, and independent practitioners",True,"Development of a VNS curriculum as a standard to be used for implanting surgeons, managing physicians, and advanced practice providers.

Transitioning to residency: a qualitative study exploring residents' perspectives on strategies for adapting to residency.,"The transition to residency (TTR) goes along with new opportunities for learning and development, which can also be challenging, despite the availability of preparation courses designed to ease the transition process. Although the TTR highly depends on the organization, individual combined with organizational strategies that advance adaptation are rarely investigated. This study explores residents' strategies and experiences with organizational strategies to help them adapt to residency. We conducted a template analysis of interview transcripts with 16 second-year residents from different hospital-based specialties in the Netherlands. To identify residents' perceptions of their own and other healthcare professionals' strategies, our template consisted of the individual and organizational strategies originating from the Organizational Socialization theory. Residents employed five individual strategies: observing, asking questions, establishing social relationships, and seeking information. These strategies helped them learn their tasks, appropriate behaviors, and integrate into their teams. On the organizational side, residents experienced six strategies, mapped through Organizational Socialization theory. Collective-individual: whether the residents felt they were treated as a group or as individuals. Formal-informal: whether the introduction period was formal, structured and explicit, or implicit and unstructured. Sequential-random: whether guidance was aligned with training levels or approached inconsistently. Fixed-variable: whether the residency program followed a fixed timeline or a flexible structure. Serial-disjunctive whether role models or experienced professionals were available for guidance or not. Investiture-divestiture: whether the healthcare team embraced residents' individuality or emphasized residents' conformity to norms. Factors influencing TTR included individual strategies, such as establishing social relationships, and organizational strategies, particularly interactional (relationships with healthcare professionals) and systemic strategies (training program structure). Residents' perceptions varied on whether these strategies facilitated or hindered their TTR. TTR involves dynamic interactions between residents and healthcare professionals, bridging individual and organizational strategies. This largely unexplored interaction adds a new dimension to Organizational Socialization theory. Importantly, residents' perceptions of these strategies varied: some thrived with independence, while others needed structured guidance. This suggests that residency programs should customize support to individual needs, balancing support and autonomy to improve transitions and enhance training.","Galema Gerbrich, Brouwer Jasperina, Bouwkamp-Timmer Tineke, Jaarsma Debbie A D C, Wietasch Götz J K G, Duvivier Robbert R J",BMC medical education,2025.0,39748348,PMC11697482,10.1186/s12909-024-06565-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39748348,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11697482,True,"Various organizational socialization strategies including collective-individual, formal-informal, sequential-random, fixed-variable, serial-disjunctive, and investiture-divestiture approaches",Second-year residents from different hospital-based specialties in the Netherlands,Improved transition to residency through customized support balancing guidance and autonomy,True,"Residents employed five individual strategies: observing, asking questions, establishing social relationships, and seeking information.

Enhancing early career development in pain medicine: the comprehensive role of mentorship.,"Mentorship plays a vital role in pain medicine, guiding professionals from medical training through independent practice. This article explores how mentorship fosters research, enhances clinical competence, and promotes multidisciplinary collaboration. Drawing on insights from leading institutions, we propose a structured mentorship framework tailored to different career stages. Effective mentorship cultivates research skills, expands academic networks, and provides early exposure to the field, shaping long-term career trajectories. It also strengthens clinical expertise, encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration, and advances diversity, equity, and inclusion in medicine. Structured academic mentorship models offer longitudinal guidance for sustained professional development. By aligning mentor-mentee goals and ensuring consistent support, mentorship programs maximize professional growth and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This article outlines key strategies and tools for building effective mentorship programs, emphasizing their transformative impact on the field of pain medicine.","Eshraghi Yashar, Barad Meredith, Pritzlaff Scott, Emerick Trent, Wahezi Sayed, Anitescu Magdalena, Kohan Lynn","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2025.0,39689028,,10.1093/pm/pnae128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39689028,,True,Structured mentorship framework tailored to different career stages,Early career pain medicine professionals,"Enhanced research skills, expanded academic networks, strengthened clinical expertise, improved cross-disciplinary collaboration, advanced diversity and inclusion, and improved patient outcomes",True,"A structured mentorship framework tailored to different career stages, aligning mentor-mentee goals and ensuring consistent support.","Professionals in pain medicine, from medical training through independent practice.","Cultivation of research skills, expansion of academic networks, early exposure to the field, shaping long-term career trajectories, strengthening of clinical expertise, encouragement of cross-disciplinary collaboration, advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion in medicine, professional growth, and improved patient outcomes."
The impact of current pediatric anesthesiology fellows shortfall on freestanding children's hospitals and practices.,"The pediatric anesthesiology workforce is currently facing a critical shortage, which will have significant consequences for patient care and the healthcare system as a whole. The workforce is aging, and despite increasing numbers of anesthesiology residents, fewer graduates are entering the field of pediatrics. It should also be noted that fewer medical school graduates are entering pediatrics as well. This situation raises concerns about the availability of specialists and the training of future physicians. To address this shortage, a comprehensive strategy is urgently needed, including outreach, mentorship, financial incentives, and policy changes to attract and retain new talent in pediatric anesthesiology. Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent a severe impact on the availability and quality of pediatric anesthesia care.","Lim Doyle, Corridore Marco, Lupa Concetta",Seminars in pediatric surgery,2024.0,39467721,,10.1016/j.sempedsurg.2024.151452,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467721,,True,"outreach, mentorship, financial incentives, and policy changes",anesthesiology residents and medical school graduates,"attract and retain new talent in pediatric anesthesiology, prevent severe impact on availability and quality of pediatric anesthesia care",True,"outreach, mentorship, financial incentives, and policy changes","anesthesiology residents, medical school graduates","attract and retain new talent in pediatric anesthesiology, prevent a severe impact on the availability and quality of pediatric anesthesia care"
Gender and Race/Ethnicity dynamics in anesthesiology mentorship: results of a European survey.,"Mentorship is crucial to career advancement, medical education, and psychosocial support, especially for women and minorities. Although anesthesia mentoring programs have shown promise, there are no survey data regarding mentor-mentee relationship dynamics. This study aimed to explore the dynamics of the anesthesia mentor/mentee relationship. A open cross-sectional web-based survey was distributed by the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care and European Society of Regional Anesthesia to European anesthesiologists. Participation was anonymous and consent was obtained. The study evaluated responses relating to preferences, facilitators, and barriers to mentorship relationships along with sociodemographic information. In total, 543 anesthesiologists responded to the survey, and 406 (111 mentees, 49 mentors, 193 both, 53 neither) responded to questions regarding mentorship. 184 anesthesiologists identified as woman and 22 as other genders (non-binary, transgender, gender-fluid, and self-described gender). Moreover, 250 anesthesiologists identified as white. Both mentors and mentees indicated that personal compatibility was the most important factor for successful mentorship. Barriers to mentorship included time consumption and perceived lack of interest from the mentor and mentee. Both mentors and mentees benefited from this relationship. The former reported feeling helpful, and the latter supported the development of clinical skills. The mentors indicated that their participation was important for protecting against burnout/exhaustion and impostor syndrome. Participants reported a preference for mentorship programs organized at the departmental level, offered at the start of the anesthesiology education curricula. Women were more likely to feel a 'lack of interest' in mentoring them as a barrier (OR = 2.49, P = 0.033). Gender was a barrier for mentors of other genders (OR = 23.9, P = 0.0027) and ethnicity (OR = 48.0, P = 0.0023). White mentees found gender (OR = 0.14, P = 0.021) and ethnicity (OR = 0.11, P = 0.048) to be less important barriers to successful mentorship relationship. When possible, programs should prioritize matching mentors and mentees based on personal compatibility and experience in the mentee's area of interest. Addressing the perceived lack of interest in mentoring is essential for promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion within anesthesiology, as well as and uplifting women and minorities.

"Residency training programs in anesthesiology, intensive care and emergency medicine: from curriculum to practice.","Residency programs in anesthesiology and intensive care (AIC), and emergency medicine (EM) continually evolve to ensure well-prepared trainees for these critical fields of healthcare. The objective of this study was to collect comprehensive feed-back from AIC and EM residents, comprising opinions and attitudes on: curriculum and structure of the residency program; scope of training environment, opportunities and complexity; training guidance and mentorship; teaching approach. An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among AIC and EM trainees during December 2023-January 2024 and June 2023-July 2023, respectively. Two hundred and thirty-five answers were collected: 137 (73/64 female/male) and 98 (55/43 female/male) respondents from the AIC and EM programs, respectively. Overall feed-back was equivalent for both residency programs, with differences related to the distinct characteristics of each medical specialty. The main issues identified across the programs were the need to improve and diversify the teaching approaches, with trainees' strong desire for more professional guidance, mentoring, and constant feed-back. The findings would inform decision-making beyond current residency programs in these critical care specialties, highlighting the need to design solutions for interactive and highly immersive educational experiences, such as simulation, augmented reality or virtual reality.","Barsac Claudiu, Petrica Alina, Lungeanu Diana, Marza Adina Maria, Bedreag Ovidiu, Papurica Marius, Trebuian Cosmin Iosif, Botea Mihai O, Mederle Ovidiu Alexandru, Sandesc Dorel",Frontiers in medicine,2024.0,39045417,PMC11264376,10.3389/fmed.2024.1386681,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39045417,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11264376,True,mentorship and guidance for residents,anesthesiology and intensive care (AIC) residents,"improved training experience and better prepared trainees through enhanced professional guidance, mentoring, and feedback",True,"Improvement and diversification of teaching approaches, professional guidance, mentoring, and constant feedback.

Faculty Onboarding for Workforce Readiness and Belonging.,"An academic anesthesiology department benefits from recruiting faculty from various centers, from new graduates to experienced clinicians. Two critical objectives for a department are getting the faculty members up-to-speed thoroughly and efficiently and retaining the faculty members to benefit from their contributions over time. Onboarding plays a pivotal role in meeting both objectives. A successful onboarding process is critical to the enculturation of new employees into an existing work environment. Organizations focusing on improving onboarding practices increase overall success, decrease attrition, and enhance member performance and satisfaction. In this study, we examine our onboarding practices and then create structured tools to improve our processes. A survey gauging the effectiveness and satisfaction of our existing onboarding practices was administered to 11 faculty members hired between 2016 and 2018. Using feedback from the survey, our team identified critical components for improvement and quality measures for onboarding from before faculty arrival until after starting clinical duties. We also measured faculty satisfaction with the onboarding process at different time points. Updated onboarding practices targeting identified areas were implemented in one hiring cycle. Thirteen new faculty members hired over the course of the course of six months assessed the new system's effectiveness. The experience of the previous cohort was compared to the new cohort, highlighting the impact of their feedback on the onboarding process. Our new best practices model, implemented to address primary gaps in our system, has shown promising results. The post-intervention cohort reported more favorable responses to the process, suggesting a positive shift in the onboarding experience. Further free-text feedback included recommendations for additional updates, offering a proactive approach to continuous improvement. A structured, feedback-responsive onboarding process improved the overall experience for new hires. While the response was overwhelmingly positive, further refinement with subsequent iterations is needed to continually improve this process.","Masaracchia Melissa M, Markowitz Scott D, Janosy Norah R, Strupp Kim M",Cureus,2024.0,39036163,PMC11260497,10.7759/cureus.62856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036163,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11260497,True,"Structured onboarding tools and processes based on faculty feedback, including components from before arrival through clinical duties",New faculty members in an academic anesthesiology department,"Improved faculty satisfaction, decreased attrition, enhanced performance, and better workforce readiness and belonging",True,"A structured, feedback-responsive onboarding process from before faculty arrival until after starting clinical duties.

Comparison of human cadaver and blue phantom for teaching ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia to novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology: A randomized controlled trial.,"Simulation is increasingly used in medical teaching. Various studies have evaluated different simulation models for training of regional anesthesia (RA). We compared the use of human cadaver and blue phantom models for training of regional anesthesia to novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology. Fifty students were taught knobology of the ultrasonography (USG) machine. They were divided into two equal groups by computer-generated random number table, and the groups assigned were kept in sealed envelopes. In group BP, students were trained on a blue phantom model, and in group HC, students were trained on human cadaver. After training, a didactic video of sonoanatomy of the supraclavicular block was shown to all participants. The block performance was then judged on patients requiring supraclavicular block. The primary objective of the study was to compare the block performance time, and secondary objectives were the quality of image acquired, orientation of transducer to the target, identification of ultrasound artifacts, errors committed, complications, and success rate. The mean block performance time was shorter in group HC compared to group BP (451.96 ± 50.25 and 526.48 ± 43.486 s, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.001). The image quality score, transducer orientation to the target, and identification of USG artifacts were better in group HC compared to group BP, with lesser number of needle passes. Cadaver-based training produced better results compared to blue phantom simulator model for teaching of ultrasound-guided RA to novice postgraduate trainees of anesthesiology.","Dang Deepanshu, Kamal Manoj, Kumar Mritunjay, Paliwal Bharat, Nayyar Ashish, Bhatia Pradeep, Singariya Geeta","Journal of anaesthesiology, clinical pharmacology",2024.0,38919433,PMC11196044,10.4103/joacp.joacp_234_22,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38919433,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11196044,True,Comparison of human cadaver versus blue phantom simulation models for teaching ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology,"Improved block performance time, better image quality, better transducer orientation, better identification of ultrasound artifacts, and fewer needle passes",True,Simulation training using human cadaver and blue phantom models for teaching ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Novice postgraduate students of anesthesiology,"Improved block performance time, quality of image acquired, orientation of transducer to the target, identification of ultrasound artifacts, lesser number of needle passes, and overall better results with cadaver-based training compared to blue phantom simulator model"

Patterns of Medical Residents' Preferences for Organizational Socialization Strategies to Facilitate Their Transitions: A Q-study.,"To facilitate various transitions of medical residents, healthcare team members and departments may employ various organizational socialization strategies, including formal and informal onboarding methods. However, residents' preferences for these organizational socialization strategies to ease their transition can vary. This study identifies patterns (viewpoints) in these preferences. Using Q-methodology, we asked a purposeful sample of early-career residents to rank a set of statements into a quasi-normal distributed grid. Statements were based on previous qualitative interviews and organizational socialization theory. Participants responded to the question, 'What are your preferences regarding strategies other health care professionals, departments, or hospitals should use to optimize your next transition?' Participants then explained their sorting choices in a post-sort questionnaire. We identified different viewpoints based on by-person (inverted) factor analysis and Varimax rotation. We interpreted the viewpoints using distinguishing and consensus statements, enriched by residents' comments. Fifty-one residents ranked 42 statements, among whom 36 residents displayed four distinct viewpoints: Dependent residents (n = 10) favored a task-oriented approach, clear guidance, and formal colleague relationships; Social Capitalizing residents (n = 9) preferred structure in the onboarding period and informal workplace social interactions; Autonomous residents (n = 12) prioritized a loosely structured onboarding period, independence, responsibility, and informal social interactions; and Development-oriented residents (n = 5) desired a balanced onboarding period that allowed independence, exploration, and development. This identification of four viewpoints highlights the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all approaches to resident transition. Healthcare professionals and departments should tailor their socialization strategies to residents' preferences for support, structure, and formal/informal social interaction.","Galema Gerbrich, Schönrock-Adema Johanna, Jaarsma Debbie A D C, Wietasch Götz J K G",Perspectives on medical education,2024.0,38496363,PMC10941690,10.5334/pme.1189,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38496363,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10941690,True,"Tailored socialization strategies based on four identified resident viewpoints (Dependent, Social Capitalizing, Autonomous, and Development-oriented)",Medical residents,"Optimized transitions for residents based on their preferences for support, structure, and formal/informal social interaction",True,Various organizational socialization strategies including formal and informal onboarding methods,Early-career medical residents,"Optimized transition of residents into their roles, tailored to their individual preferences for support, structure, and formal/informal social interaction"
Early exposure to anesthesiology: a summer preceptorship program for first-year medical students.,"A 4-week summer preceptorship offered first-year medical students early exposure to anesthesiology following their preclerkship courses in pharmacology and cardiopulmonary physiology. The main objective was to provide students with clinical skills and prepare them for rotations while immersing them in a unique experience, introducing a specialty not covered in core rotations. Participants were selected via their responses to an application. In addition to shadowing anesthesiologists, curriculum components included weekly faculty lectures on core aspects of anesthesiology (introductory basics, perioperative drugs, airway, and crisis management); multiple simulation labs (workstation setup, intubation clinics, intravenous and central line placement, ultrasound techniques); research opportunities; and mentorship from physicians and senior medical students. The program culminated in each student successfully leading a simulated case to receive a certificate of completion. A survey of 15 participants revealed significant improvements in ability to intubate (<i>P</i> < 0.05), ability to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (<i>P</i> < 0.05), interest in anesthesiology as a specialty (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and preparedness for future rotations (<i>P</i> < 0.05). This program accelerates clinical exposure for preclerkship students, providing insights into anesthesiology early in their medical journey. It provides research and mentorship, fosters professional growth, and enhances individual competitiveness for residency program applications.","Long Sloan, Sorrels Cole, Cook Richard, Murillo Sergio, Dutton Richard, Gunn Daniel, Ramamoorthy Saravanan",Proceedings (Baylor University.

Women in Anesthesiology and the Mid-Career Stall: Why They Are Not Advancing Into Senior Leadership.,"Women anesthesiologists face many challenges when trying to advance their careers and find balance in personal and professional endeavors. In this article, we introduce the reader to several concepts central to understanding the challenges faced by mid-career women anesthesiologists and highlight why these challenges become particularly pronounced when women enter the mid-career stage. We describe how lack of constructive actionable feedback combined with lack of mentorship and sponsorship negatively affects women in the workplace. We also outline barriers and bias that mid-career women anesthesiologists face in high-level leadership roles along with the disproportionally high burden of nonpromotable work. We present a discussion of mistreatment and burnout, which are compounded by concurrent demands of parenthood and a professional career. We conclude with the impact that these barriers have on mid-career women anesthesiologists and recommendations for mitigating these challenges. They include a systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, an individualized professional development strategy, and an improved and comprehensive approach to promotion.","Mondal Samhati, Oakes Daryl, Humphrey Tara, Kolarczyk Lavinia, Trzcinka Agnieszka",Anesthesia and analgesia,2024.0,38289857,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38289857,,True,"Systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, individualized professional development strategy, and improved approach to promotion",Mid-career women anesthesiologists,Advancement into senior leadership positions and mitigation of career challenges,True,"Systematic increase in mentorship and sponsorship, individualized professional development strategy, improved and comprehensive approach to promotion",Mid-career women anesthesiologists,"Mitigating challenges faced by mid-career women anesthesiologists, advancement into senior leadership roles"
A Nurse Anesthesiology Mentorship Program: An Evidence-Based Project for Implementation.,"Transitioning from the role of student to the professional certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), as well as a CRNA transitioning to a new job can be very difficult because of uncertainty in the new environment when compounded by a lack of social support.

Thoracoscopic Resection of Pulmonary Lesions in Israel: The Mentorship Approach.,"Most congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) are detected antenatally. The majority of newborns are asymptomatic. Patients are prone to subsequent respiratory complications and to a lesser extent malignant transformation remains concerning. In Israel, until 2013, pediatric surgeries were performed by thoracotomy. To minimize its morbidity, we introduced thoracoscopy using a mentorship approach. We present our experience with thoracoscopic resections coordinated by the mentorship of a pediatric worldwide leader in his field and compare our results with resections performed by thoracotomy. A retrospective review of records of children operated between 2013 and 2020 was conducted. Data were compared using <i>t</i>-test for quantitative variables. Fifty patients were operated by thoracoscopy with a median age of 4 years, a thoracoscopic lobectomy performed in 68%. There was no conversion with a median length of stay (LOS) of 3½ days. Thirty patients were operated by thoracotomy by a thoracic surgeon with a median age of 3.5 years. A lobectomy was performed in 87% with a median LOS of 7 days. Thoracoscopic lobectomy is a technically demanding procedure with a long learning curve, strongly related to the low volume of cases. The role of a mentorship program in acquiring those surgical skills is crucial through standardization of the technique applied and supervised by the mentor. Early thoracoscopy for congenital pulmonary lesions at an early age can be achieved with a low conversion rate and minimal complications creating a change in the paradigm of practice when considering surgery for CPAM in Israel.","Seguier-Lipszyc Emmanuelle, Rothenberg S, Mei-Zahav Meir, Stafler Patrick, Zeitlin Yelena, Samuk Inbal, Peysakhovich Yuri, Kravarusic Dragan",Journal of Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons,2023.0,38173630,PMC10760613,10.4103/jiaps.jiaps_115_23,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38173630,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10760613,True,Mentorship approach with a pediatric worldwide leader supervising thoracoscopic techniques,Pediatric surgeons in Israel learning thoracoscopic resection techniques,Acquisition of thoracoscopic surgical skills with low conversion rates and minimal complications for congenital pulmonary lesions,True,Mentorship approach in thoracoscopic resections,Pediatric surgeons performing thoracoscopic resections,"Acquisition of surgical skills, standardization of the technique, low conversion rate and minimal complications"
Implementation of an Un-Pairing Passport to Improve the Transition From Intern to Resident During a Critical Period of Anesthesiology Residency Training.,"The transition from intern year to the first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1) is a challenging period for residents and their supervisors. Orientation methods and instructional material targeting this transition vary across U.S. residency programs. An un-pairing passport was implemented during the 2021-2022 transition to guide and provide expectations for interns, senior residents, and staff. The objective of this quality improvement project was to assess the effectiveness of the passport in improving the transition period and overall preparedness of the new CA-1s. We surveyed 3 groups (CA-1s, CA-2s/CA-3s, and staff anesthesiologists) 6 months after the completion of passport implementation to retrospectively assess the 2021-2022 CA-1 class's preparedness across 7 domains compared with those who transitioned before passport implementation. Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> statistics and median effect sizes were used to compare pre- and postintervention. Self-reflected preparedness scores of the CA-1s were higher across all domains compared with the senior resident group (r = 0.328-0.548). Overall level of comfort and preparedness for the start of the CA-1 year was higher in the postintervention group (r = 0.162- 0.514). Staff anesthesiologists' perceived preparedness of the residents was also higher across all domains for the postintervention group (r = 0.197-0.387). The un-pairing passport improved residents' and staff anesthesiologists' subjective assessments of the readiness of new CA-1 residents after a critical transition in their training. Similar tools can be more broadly applied to other anesthesiology residency and possibly fellowship programs as well as subspecialty rotations within those programs.","Soppe Ashley N, Hauser Joshua M, Jacobson Andrew R, McElrath Angela D",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2023.0,38162707,PMC10753154,10.46374/volxxv_issue4_Soppe,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38162707,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10753154,True,Un-pairing passport implementation to guide and provide expectations during transition from intern to CA-1 year,Anesthesiology residents transitioning from intern year to first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1),Improved preparedness and comfort of new CA-1 residents during the critical transition period,True,"Implementation of an un-pairing passport to guide and provide expectations for interns, senior residents, and staff","Interns transitioning to the first year of clinical anesthesiology residency (CA-1), senior residents, and staff anesthesiologists","Improved transition period and overall preparedness of the new CA-1s, higher self-reflected preparedness scores, and higher perceived preparedness by staff anesthesiologists"
Association between an anesthesia department development program for junior faculty and long-term production of publications: A longitudinal cohort study.,"An important mission of academic medical departments is to further the scholarship and education of its junior faculty. In 2013, Hindman et al. described the design and initial outcomes of a faculty development program for junior faculty at the University of Iowa Department of Anesthesia. In the current study, we reassessed whether the program increased the production of publications long-term. We included all department faculty, years before joining the department, and years after leaving the department, to control for the effects of simply being current faculty in the department, benefiting from its resources, and having had progressively more experience working. The population studied was the faculty for any period between January 2006 and December 2022. The dependent variable was the count of publications in Scopus each year with the faculty member's Scopus identifier, 1996 through 2022. The two-year faculty development program included non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies. Statistical analyses were with logistic and Poisson random effect models for panel data, with standard errors estimated using jackknife resampling. Among the 128 distinct faculty in the department from 2006 through 2022, the 10% with the most publications per year accounted for 54% of the total annual publications. The two-year program was completed by 41% (53/128). Completion of the faculty development program was associated with a 17% absolute increase in the predicted marginal probability of one or more publications per year, from 25% to 41%. The 95% confidence interval for the 17% absolute increase was 9% to 24% (P < .0001). The predictive marginal effect of completing the program was 1.7 more publications per year per faculty (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.4, P < .0001). The estimate was also 1.7 more publications per year while limiting consideration to the 108 faculty who joined the department after 1996 and including as an independent variable the count of publications the year before joining the department. A faculty development program for junior faculty can reliably increase the production of publications in an anesthesiology department by at least one per year. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in publication production among faculty.","Dexter Franklin, Epstein Richard H, Hindman Bradley J",Journal of clinical anesthesia,2024.0,38133566,,10.1016/j.jclinane.2023.111308,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38133566,,True,"Two-year faculty development program including non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies",Junior faculty in an anesthesiology department,Increased production of publications,True,"The two-year faculty development program included non-clinical time, two mentors, defined mentorship plan, didactic program, and financial support for clinical and/or laboratory studies.",Junior faculty at the University of Iowa Department of Anesthesia,"Completion of the faculty development program was associated with a 17% absolute increase in the predicted marginal probability of one or more publications per year, from 25% to 41%.

Analysis of a Needs Assessment Survey to Develop an Online Resource Repository Supporting Nurse Anesthesia Educators.,"Without highly qualified nurse anesthesia educators and administrators, the health care system will be threatened by the inadequate supply of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). American Association of Nurse Anesthesiologists' Faculty Stabilization Task Force (FSTF) analyzed reasons for high faculty turnover and developed recommendations to support nurse anesthesia faculty and administrators. A survey evaluated participants' current role, leadership development opportunities, mentorship experiences, and resource needs. Of 109 respondents, 87 (80%) were program administrators or assistant administrators with less than 5 years of experience in their role. Despite academic experience, 51% felt adequately prepared for their role. The FSTF provided 2 recommendations: to create a robust faculty development program for all faculty at all levels of CRNA education and a repository of information needed for program administrators and faculty to oversee and educate students in a high-quality CRNA program.","Lee Rebecca, Bonanno Laura, O'Sullivan Cormac, Anderson Michael, Everson Marjorie, Moore Erica, O'Guin Crystal, Thompson Judy, Morgan Brett, Greenier Ewa, Pantone Gina",Nurse educator,,38113930,,10.1097/NNE.0000000000001559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38113930,,True,Creating a repository of information and a robust faculty development program,Nurse anesthesia educators and administrators (CRNAs),"Better preparation for roles, reduced faculty turnover, and maintaining high-quality CRNA education programs",True,Creation of a robust faculty development program for all faculty at all levels of CRNA education and a repository of information needed for program administrators and faculty,"Nurse anesthesia educators and administrators, particularly those with less than 5 years of experience in their role","Better preparation and support for nurse anesthesia faculty and administrators, leading to improved oversight and education of students in high-quality CRNA programs"

"Assuring the Groundwork for Success: Mentorship, Sponsorship, and Allyship for Practicing Anesthesiologists.","The challenges facing the health care industry in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic world are numerous, jeopardizing wellness, and performance. Maintaining engagement and fulfillment of anesthesiologists in their work is now a critical issue in various practice settings: academic, private practice, and corporate medicine. In this article, we offer insights on how mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship are important in the advancement of the anesthesiology workforce including women and underrepresented minorities inclusive of race, gender, and disability. Mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship require a framework that intentionally addresses the programmatic structures needed to optimize the environment for increasing women, underrepresented minorities, and other diverse groups. These 3 distinct yet interrelated concepts are defined with a discussion on the value of implementation. In addition, the concept of ""belonging"" and its importance in enhancing the culture in anesthesiology is explored. We believe that part of the solution to wellness, recruitment and retention and improved job satisfaction of clinicians is having an environment where mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship are foundational.","Diallo Mofya S, Wright Crystal C, Coombs Alice A Tolbert, Vetter Thomas R",Anesthesia and analgesia,2023.0,37712466,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37712466,,True,"Mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship framework","Anesthesiologists, particularly women and underrepresented minorities inclusive of race, gender, and disability","Enhanced wellness, recruitment, retention, job satisfaction, and improved culture of belonging in anesthesiology",True,"Mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship","Anesthesiologists, including women and underrepresented minorities inclusive of race, gender, and disability","Wellness, recruitment and retention, improved job satisfaction"
"Academic anaesthesiology: a global perspective on training, support, and future development of early career researchers.","As anaesthesiologists face increasing clinical demands and a limited and competitive funding environment for academic work, the sustainability of academic anaesthesiologists has never been more tenuous. Yet, the speciality needs academic anaesthesiologists in many roles, extending beyond routine clinical duties. Anaesthesiologist educators, researchers, and administrators are required not only to train future generations but also to lead innovation and expansion of anaesthesiology and related specialities, all to improve patient care. This group of early career researchers with geographically distinct training and practice backgrounds aim to highlight the diversity in clinical and academic training and career development pathways for anaesthesiologists globally. Although multiple routes to success exist, one common thread is the need for consistent support of strong mentors and sponsors. Moreover, to address inequitable opportunities, we emphasise the need for diversity and inclusivity through global collaboration and exchange that aims to improve access to research training and participation. We are optimistic that by focusing on these fundamental principles, we can help build a more resilient and sustainable future for academic anaesthesiologists around the world.","Stundner Ottokar, Adams Meredith C B, Fronczek Jakub, Kaura Vikas, Li Li, Allen Megan L, Vail Emily A",British journal of anaesthesia,2023.0,37684165,PMC10636519,10.1016/j.bja.2023.07.030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37684165,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10636519,True,"Mentorship, sponsorship, global collaboration and exchange for research training",Early career researchers in anaesthesiology,Building a more resilient and sustainable future for academic anaesthesiologists globally,True,"Consistent support of strong mentors and sponsors, diversity and inclusivity through global collaboration and exchange",Early career researchers in anesthesiology,Build a more resilient and sustainable future for academic anesthesiologists around the world

A new inexpensive ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization simulation model.,"Central venous catheters (CVCs) are life-saving tools for fluid therapy during surgery. Ultrasound-guided CVC placement has been shown to be safe and highly efficient. However, it is difficult for medical workers with less experience in ultrasonography to acquire the necessary skill in a short time. Simulation-based training is a good way to enhance the skill of a beginner. Therefore, in this study, we introduced a new, inexpensive and easily implemented model for ultrasound-guided CVC placement training and assessed the feasibility of this model. This was a quasi-experimental study. Thirty-three anaesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents with strong CVC interest were included in a simulator-based training workshop in a department of anaesthesiology. The simulation model consisted of a piece of pork and two latex catheters filled with red and blue ink. The workshop comprised 3 parts: a 10-min introductory lecture, a 15-min orientation on performing ultrasound-guided CVC insertion based on the model, and a 30-min practice session. Participants completed relevant questionnaires before and after the training. Moreover, an examination was held to evaluate their skill with the novel model. All participants indicated that the novel model increased their self-perceived confidence in ultrasound-guided catheterization. They also all reported that the model was adequate for training anaesthesiology residents in ultrasound-guided catheterization. A few individuals thought the model did not mimic the progress of CVC insertion (3 of 33). After training, participants did not show a significant difference in the acquisition of central venous catheterization theory. However, their competency with ultrasound-guided CVC placement was enhanced. This was demonstrated not only based on subjective answers to the following questions, namely, ""how do you perform central venous catheterization with ultrasound guidance?"" (p < 0.001), ""can you perform ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization?"" (p < 0.001), and ""how much self-confidence do you have in performing ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization?"" (p < 0.001), but also in objective performance (evaluation of the core step in ultrasound-guided placement (p < 0.001)). The new simulator is a feasible, inexpensive and easily reproducible tool for training anaesthesiologists in ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization. After the simulation-based training workshop, the competency of residents in performing central venous catheterization with ultrasound guidance improved.","Liu Yan, Li Jiemei, Chang Jinzhu, Xiao Shaoling, Pei Wenbo, Wang Lei",BMC medical education,2023.0,36774471,PMC9921340,10.1186/s12909-023-04080-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36774471,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9921340,True,Simulation-based training workshop using a new inexpensive ultrasound-guided CVC placement model,Anesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents,Improved competency and self-confidence in performing ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization,True,Simulation-based training workshop for ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization,Anaesthesiology postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents with strong CVC interest,Enhanced competency in ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization and increased self-perceived confidence in ultrasound-guided catheterization
Pediatric Project ECHO<sup>®</sup> for Pain: implementation and mixed methods evaluation of a virtual medical education program to support interprofessional pain management in children and youth.,"Pediatric pain is a complex health challenge requiring a multi-modal management approach. It is critical that healthcare providers (HCPs) have access to ongoing, flexible education and mentorship specific to pediatric pain. However, there are significant gaps in available pain education and a need for more opportunities to support interprofessional training. Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is a model for delivering online HCP education and cultivating a virtual community of practice. Within the pediatric pain setting, ECHO® has potential to improve local access to specialized pain knowledge, particularly among the physicians, nurses, and allied health providers who primarily manage these cases in community and hospital settings across rural and urban environments. The purpose of this study was three-fold. First, to evaluate the feasibility (participation levels, acceptability) of implementing Project ECHO® in the context of pediatric pain. Second, to measure preliminary program impacts on HCP knowledge, self-efficacy, and clinical practice. Third, to characterize HCP program engagement levels before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A needs assessment was conducted to identify interprofessional education gaps and inform the program curriculum. The no-cost Pediatric ECHO® for Pain program offered TeleECHO sessions (didactic and case-based learning) as well as foundational education. Surveys were distributed at baseline and 6 months to assess outcomes using 7-point Likert scales. Participant engagement was assessed for periods prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted. Eighty-five TeleECHO sessions were hosted, with a mean attendance of 34.1 ± 23.4 HCPs. Acceptability scores at 6 months (n = 33) ranged from 5.0 ± 1.4 to 6.5 ± 0.5. Participants reported statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements in knowledge (7 out of 7 topics) and self-efficacy (8 out of 9 skills). Most participants reported positive practice impacts, including improved satisfaction with managing children with pain. Exploratory analyses showed a trend of greater engagement from ECHO® learners after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project ECHO® is a feasible and impactful model for virtual education of interprofessional HCPs in managing pediatric pain.","Lalloo C, Mohabir V, Campbell F, Sun N, Klein S, Tyrrell J, Mesaroli G, Ataollahi-Eshqoor S, Osei-Twum J, Stinson J",BMC medical education,2023.0,36709273,PMC9883812,10.1186/s12909-023-04023-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36709273,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9883812,True,Project ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) - a virtual medical education program offering TeleECHO sessions (didactic and case-based learning) and foundational education for pediatric pain management,"Interprofessional healthcare providers (HCPs) including physicians, nurses, and allied health providers who manage pediatric pain cases in community and hospital settings across rural and urban environments","Improved HCP knowledge, self-efficacy, and clinical practice in pediatric pain management; creation of a virtual community of practice; improved local access to specialized pain knowledge",True,Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) model for delivering online HCP education and cultivating a virtual community of practice.

A formal evaluation of The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic orientation session: A quality improvement project.,"Chronic pain affects approximately one in every five Canadians and has a substantial impact on psychological well-being, relationships, ability to attend work or school, and overall functioning.The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic introduced orientation sessions, with the aim of providing new patients with pain education to help prepare patients for engagement with multimodal pain management strategies. This report summarizes the results of a formative evaluation of the orientation session at The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic to determine whether patients perceived the orientation session as beneficial. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and then thematically analyzed to understand patients' perspectives on the orientation session. Coding was done by two team members using the constant comparison analyses method with key ideas, concepts, and patterns identified and compared to identify similarities. Between September 6 and October 18, 2019, 18 patients attended an orientation session and 12 consented to participation and completed telephone interviews. The six themes identified included (1) feeling of community, (2) participants feeling heard by providers, (3) appreciation of the holistic approach, (4) availability of community resources, (5) barriers to access, and (6) discordant feelings of preparedness for the physician appointment. Results from this evaluation indicate that the orientation session offered at The Ottawa Hospital Pain Clinic improves chronic pain literacy, reduces feeling of isolation, and instills hope.

"Evaluating the Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative: Supporting mentorship, career satisfaction, and well-being among pediatric anesthesiologists.","The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia launched the Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) in 2018 to empower highly productive women pediatric anesthesiologists to achieve equity, promotion, and leadership. WELI is focused on six career development domains: promotion and leadership, networking, conceptualization and completion of projects, mentoring, career satisfaction, and sense of well-being. We sought feedback about whether WELI supported members' career development by surveys emailed in November 2020 (baseline), May 2021 (6 months), and January 2022 (14 months). Program feedback was quantitatively evaluated by the Likert scale questions and qualitatively evaluated by extracting themes from free-text question responses. The response rates were 60.5% (92 of 152) for the baseline, 51% (82 of 161) for the 6-month, and 52% (96 of 185) for the 14-month surveys. Five main themes were identified from the free-text responses in the 6- and 14-month surveys. Members reported that WELI helped them create meaningful connections through networking, obtain new career opportunities, find tools and projects that supported their career advancement and promotion, build the confidence to try new things beyond their comfort zone, and achieve better work-life integration. Frustration with the inability to connect in-person during the coronavirus-19 pandemic was highlighted. Advisors further stated that WELI helped them improve their mentorship skills and gave them insight into early career faculty issues. Relative to the baseline survey, protégés reported greater contributions from WELI at 6 months in helping them clarify their priorities, increase their sense of achievement, and get promoted. These benefits persisted through 14 months. Advisors reported a steady increase in forming new meaningful relationships and finding new collaborators through WELI over time. All the members reported that their self-rated mentoring abilities improved at 6 months with sustained improvement at 14 months. Thus, programs such as WELI can assist women anesthesiologists and foster gender equity in career development, promotion, and leadership.","Deutsch Nina, Yanofsky Samuel D, Markowitz Scott D, Tackett Sean, Berenstain Laura K, Schwartz Lawrence I, Flick Randall, Heitmiller Eugenie, Fiadjoe John, Lee Helen H, Honkanen Anita, Malviya Shobha, Lee Jennifer K, Schwartz Jamie McElrath",Paediatric anaesthesia,2023.0,36331372,,10.1111/pan.14596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36331372,,True,Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) mentorship program,Women pediatric anesthesiologists,"Career development, promotion, leadership advancement, improved mentorship skills, networking, project completion, career satisfaction, and well-being",True,"The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) focuses on six career development domains: promotion and leadership, networking, conceptualization and completion of projects, mentoring, career satisfaction, and sense of well-being.",Women pediatric anesthesiologists,"Members reported that WELI helped them create meaningful connections through networking, obtain new career opportunities, find tools and projects that supported their career advancement and promotion, build the confidence to try new things beyond their comfort zone, and achieve better work-life integration.

A Call to Action: A Specialty-Specific Course to Support the Next Generation of Clinician Scientists in Anesthesiology.,"Clinical production pressure is a significant problem for faculty of anesthesiology departments who seek to remain involved in research. Lack of protected time to dedicate to research and insufficient external funding add to this long-standing issue. Recent trends in funding to the departments of anesthesiology and their academic output validate these concerns. A 2022 study examining National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant recipients associated with anesthesiology departments across 10 years (2011-2020) outlines total awarded funds at $1,676,482,440, with most of the funds awarded to only 10 departments in the United States. Of note, the total 1-year NIH funding in 2021 for academic internal medicine departments was 3 times higher than the 10-year funding of anesthesiology departments. Additionally, American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) diplomats represent a minority (37%) of the anesthesiology researchers obtaining grant funding, with a small number of faculty members receiving a prevalence of monies. Overall, the number of publications per academic anesthesiologist across the United States remains modest as does the impact of the scholarly work. Improving environments in which academic anesthesiologists thrive may be paramount to successful academic productivity. In fact, adding to the lack of academic time is the limited bandwidth of senior academic physicians to mentor and support aspiring physician scientists. Given then the challenges for individual departments and notable successes of specialty-specific collaborative efforts (eg Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research [FAER]), additional pooled-resource approaches may be necessary to successfully support and develop clinician scientists. It is in this spirit that the leadership of <i>Anesthesia and Analgesia and the Journal of Education in Perioperative Medicine</i>, unified with the Association of University Anesthesiologists, aim to sponsor the Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course. Directed toward early career academic anesthesiologists who wish to gain competency specifically in the fundamentals of clinical research and receive mentorship to develop an investigative project, the yearlong course will provide participants with the skills necessary to design research initiatives, ethically direct research teams, successfully communicate ideas with data analysts, and write and submit scientific articles. Additionally, the course, articulated in a series of interactive lectures, mentored activities, and workshops, will teach participants to review articles submitted for publication to medical journals and to critically appraise evidence in published research. It is our hope that this initiative will be of interest to junior faculty of academic anesthesiology departments nationally and internationally.","Cavallone Laura F, Duggan Elizabeth W, Berger Jeffrey S",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2022.0,36274996,PMC9583761,10.46374/volxxiv_issue3_cavallone,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36274996,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9583761,True,"Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course - a yearlong course with interactive lectures, mentored activities, and workshops",Early career academic anesthesiologists who wish to gain competency in clinical research,"Participants will gain skills to design research initiatives, ethically direct research teams, communicate with data analysts, write scientific articles, review journal submissions, and critically appraise evidence",True,"Introduction to Clinical Research for Academic Anesthesiologists (ICRAA) Course.

Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change for Mentorship in Nurse Anesthesia Programs.,"Student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs) undergo enormous stress related to the lifestyle changes that are necessary to commit to full-time training in nurse anesthesia programs (NAPs). Mentorship and mentoring initiatives have proved to provide positive support to enhance SRNA wellness. This interventional study was conducted to assess the status of mentorship and mentorship initiatives in NAPs and to understand and analyze the specific constructs of organizational change from the perspective of nurse anesthesia program directors toward mentorship after viewing an educational online video regarding the topics of stress of an SRNA, mentorship and formalized mentorship programs. NAP state of mentorship information from NAPDs (n = 36) was conducted to obtain the current descriptive statistics of mentorship in NAPs. An adapted Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change survey was conducted to assess for six constructs of change by applicable study participants (n = 26).

Utilizing Competence-Based Simulation to Improve Orientation Outcomes.,"New graduate respiratory therapists (RTs), regardless of the degree program, receive limited preparation in neonatal/pediatric diseases and management. Experienced RTs typically have adult knowledge but limited exposure to pediatrics. We developed a program that included competence-based simulation to improve orientation success. A 9-week orientation program curriculum with simulation-based competence assessment was developed to ensure all new hires gained knowledge and skills to perform pediatric clinical tasks. Each new hire individually completed the same simulation scenarios during the first week and last week of orientation. Curriculum changes were made over time based on performance in simulations and on-the-job knowledge and skills during and after orientation. Paired and unpaired <i>t</i> tests were used with <i>P</i> < .05 as significant. From January 2017-February 2020, the program had 3 updates. Noninvasive ventilation and decompensating patient scenarios were completed for all periods. Ninety-two new staff were oriented in period 1 = 29 (new graduate RTs 20, experienced RTs 9); period 2 = 17 (new graduate RTs 10, experienced RTs 7); period 3 = 24 (new graduate RTs 21, experienced RTs 3), and period 4 = 22 (new graduate RTs = 22). Remediation during orientation occurred in 15% of the staff. Seventy-one percent successfully advanced to ICU orientation after completion of the program. All staff improved scores between pre- versus post-simulations in all periods: mean difference ± SD period 1: new graduate RTs 32.0 ± 17.0, <i>P</i> < .001; experienced RTs 28.0 ± 18.9, <i>P</i> < .001; period 2: new graduate RTs 23.0 ± 15.2, <i>P</i> < .001; experienced RTs 29.0 ± 12.1, <i>P</i> < .001; period 3: new graduate RTs 26.0 ± 15.8, <i>P</i> < .001; experienced RTs 27.0 ± 15.1, <i>P</i> = .007; and period 4: new graduate RTs 19.0 ± 14.5, <i>P</i> < .001, paired <i>t</i> test. The scores between new graduate RTs and experienced RTs during post-simulation were not significantly different for period 1 (<i>P</i> = .35) but were significantly different for periods 2-4 (<i>P</i> = .040, unpaired <i>t</i> test).

"Evaluation and Analysis of Fellow Learning and Education Curriculum in a Regional Anesthesiology and Acute Pain Medicine Fellowship: A Prospective, Observational Pilot Study.","Since 2017, several regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellowship programs throughout the country have developed various educational didactic curriculums to address the core medical knowledge requirements as set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Given the paucity of existing literature regarding the medical knowledge acquisition of regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows, this study aimed to determine how quickly these fellows learn during their fellowship year, with a secondary aim of analyzing a new educational didactic curriculum in its goal of delivering the required medical knowledge. An 89-question, multiple-choice examination was administered to the 2020-2021 regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center during orientation and again at 4 months and 8 months into the fellowship. A secondary analysis of anonymous deidentified answers was completed. Fellows averaged 64%, 74%, and 79% correct responses on the orientation, 4-month, and 8-month exams, respectively. An analysis of the orientation exam revealed that the most commonly incorrect answers stemmed from topics including lower extremity nerve blocks, truncal blocks, and neuraxial anesthesia. The 4-month exam showed overall marked improvement; however, truncal blocks remained the most missed topic. Topics with 100% correct response rates in all examinations were local anesthetic pharmacology and systemic opioids. The results of this study indicate that a large portion of learning occurs during the first 4 months of the fellowship and slows thereafter. Using this simple form of fellowship evaluation, changes to an educational didactic curriculum can be implemented to reach medical knowledge goals more effectively and efficiently as required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.","Klosowski Maciej Z, Schott Nicholas J",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2022.0,35707019,PMC9176400,10.46374/volxxiv_issue1_schott,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35707019,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9176400,True,"Educational didactic curriculum with multiple-choice examinations administered at orientation, 4 months, and 8 months into fellowship",Regional anesthesiology and acute pain medicine fellows at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,Effective and efficient medical knowledge acquisition to meet Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements,True,"An 89-question, multiple-choice examination was administered to the fellows during orientation and again at 4 months and 8 months into the fellowship.

Supporting the Foundation of Nurse Anesthesia Education: A Report of the Faculty Stabilization Taskforce.,"Without highly qualified educators and educational program administrators, the ability to provide anesthesia and pain management services throughout the healthcare system will be threatened by the inadequate supply of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). The average turnover rate between the years 2016-2020, for CRNA program administrators, was 15% with some programs changing leadership as often as every two to four years. In response, the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) and the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs (COA) created the Faculty Stabilization Taskforce (FSTF) to review reasons for the high turnover rate and to develop methods and tools to support program faculty and administrators in their role of educating the future CRNA workforce. The FSTF provided two recommendations: 1) to create a robust faculty development program for all faculty at all levels of CRNA education, and 2) to create a repository of information needed to administrate, and educate students, in a high-quality CRNA program. This article summarizes the report made to the AANA Board of Directors (BOD) which was unanimously accepted and is already being implemented by AANA and COA staff.

Gender Gap: A Qualitative Study of Women and Leadership Acquisition in Anesthesiology.,"The representation of women among leaders in the field of anesthesia continues to trail that of their male counterparts. This qualitative study was conducted to understand the pathway of leadership acquisition among women in the field of anesthesiology. Using constructivist grounded theory, we sought to determine whether there were specific internal or external factors that were common to women in leadership in the specialty field of anesthesiology, and specifically, how they obtained leadership positions. Semistructured interviews were conducted for data collection. A total of 26 women in leadership positions in anesthesiology participated in this study. The analysis of these interviews resulted in the development of 4 common themes related to career pathways for these women in leadership. Each theme was examined in depth to determine the qualities necessary for individuals to advance in the field and the pathway to obtaining leadership positions. The findings of this study showed that early-career, high-value mentorship and sponsorship were important factors in leadership acquisition. Most participants (n = 20; 76%) had early mentors. Of those with early mentorship, 13 (65%) had high-value mentors, who we define as someone with power or authority. Sponsorship was the leading factor contributing to leadership acquisition. The results of this qualitative study may serve as a guide for encouraging female anesthesiologists with leadership aspirations. We suggest that the specialty field of anesthesiology institute targeted measures to help increase the percentage of women leadership with formal sponsorship programs at the local and national levels.","Basile Ellen R, Byrd Heather, Powell-Williams Melissa, Polania Gutierrez Javier J, Riveros-Perez Efrain",Anesthesia and analgesia,2023.0,35550391,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35550391,,True,"early-career, high-value mentorship and formal sponsorship programs",women in anesthesiology with leadership aspirations,increased percentage of women in leadership positions in anesthesiology,True,"Early-career, high-value mentorship and sponsorship",Female anesthesiologists with leadership aspirations,Increase the percentage of women leadership with formal sponsorship programs at the local and national levels
Perception Precedes Reality: A Simulation and Procedural Bootcamp Improves Residents' Comfort With Transitioning to Clinical Anesthesiology Training.,"Background The transition from internship to clinical anesthesiology (CA) training is often difficult given the differences in workflow, procedures, environment, and clinical situations. The primary aims of this study were to determine if a standardized introductory bootcamp could improve clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level of new anesthesiology residents in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems. The secondary aim of the study was to see if a standardized bootcamp could be replicated at other programs. Methods The introduction to anesthesiology resident bootcamp was developed at one institution in 2015 then expanded to a second program in 2019. The bootcamp was a one-day experience consisting of simulation and task trainers that all rising first-year CA residents (CA-1) participated in during their first month of anesthesiology training. All participating residents were given a survey immediately before and after the bootcamp. The average ratings of the questions were calculated and used as the primary measure. The Anesthesia Knowledge Test (AKT) was used as a surrogate measure of participant knowledge. Results From 2015 to 2020, a total of 105 residents completed the pre-survey and 109 completed the post-survey across the two sites. The improvement in average rating was significant (Pre: 2.04±0.46 versus Post: 3.09±0.52 p<0.0001). Individual item analysis also showed significant improvement on all of the eight items (p<0.0001). Analyses by site revealed the same results at both average score and item level. There was no significant cohort difference in either AKT-0 (Control: 57.84±26.86 versus Intervention 50.13±25.14, p=0.14) or AKT-1 (Control: 41.06±26.42 versus Intervention 41.70±26.60, p=0.90) percentile scores. Conclusions Incorporation of an introduction to anesthesia bootcamp for new residents significantly improves participant comfort level and is reproducible across institutions. However, it does not improve resident performance on standardized tests.","Kazior Michael R, Chen Fei, Isaak Robert, Dhandha Vishal, Cobb Kathryn W",Cureus,2022.0,35242473,PMC8883744,10.7759/cureus.21706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35242473,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8883744,True,One-day bootcamp consisting of simulation and task trainers for new anesthesiology residents,Rising first-year clinical anesthesiology residents (CA-1),Improved clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems,True,A one-day introductory bootcamp consisting of simulation and task trainers for new anesthesiology residents during their first month of anesthesiology training.,New anesthesiology residents transitioning from internship to clinical anesthesiology (CA) training.,Improvement in clinical knowledge and self-perceived comfort level of new anesthesiology residents in performing common operating room procedures and management of common intraoperative problems.
Evaluation of a quality improvement bundle aimed to reduce opioid prescriptions after Cesarean delivery: an interrupted time series study.,"To evaluate whether opioid prescriptions at discharge after Cesarean delivery decreased following implementation of a quality improvement bundle. A quality improvement bundle was instituted at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Interventions included opioid prescribing instructions in resident orientation, nursing and patient education, and standard electronic prescriptions. We used an interrupted time series study design and included patients who had a Cesarean delivery six months pre intervention and six months post intervention. Primary outcome data (opioids prescribed at discharge in morphine milliequivalents [MME]), were aggregated (averaged) by calendar week and analyzed using interrupted time series. Secondary outcomes were assessed using bivariate methods and included opioid use for breakthrough pain in hospital, and amount of opioids prescribed by prescriber specialty and training level. We included 2,578 women in our analysis. Based on the segmented regression analysis, prescribed opioids decreased from 97.6 MME in 2018 to 35.8 MME in 2019 (difference in means, - 61.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 72.2 to - 51.3; P < 0.001), and this decrease was sustained over the study period. Post intervention, there were no visits to our postnatal assessment clinic for inadequate pain control.

"A qualitative evaluation of an operational research course for acute care trainees in Kigali, Rwanda.","the blended SORT-IT model uses a combination of online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors to teach operational research. We modified SORT-IT to create the Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course directed to anesthesiology residents in Kigali, Rwanda. This course takes students from an initial research idea through submitting a paper for publication. Our viewpoint on entering this study was that ACOR participants would have adequate resources to complete the course, but be hampered by cultural unfamiliarity with the blended teaching approach. we conducted a qualitative analysis of the experiences of all those who participated in the ACOR course to understand obstacles and improve future course iterations. Six anesthesiology residents participated in the first iteration of the course, with 4 local mentors and 2 secondary mentors, one of whom was based at the University of Virginia, with a total of 12 participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants and mentors, which were independently coded for topics by two reviewers. there was a 50% publication rate for those enrolled in the course and an expected 100% acceptance rate for those who completed the course. Some reported benefits to the course included improved research knowledge, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange. Some reported obstacles to successful course completion included time limitations, background knowledge, and communication. Of note, only 4 out of 12 participants recognized cultural barriers. although successful in the sense that all participants completed their research project, ACOR did not fully solve the main issues hindering research training. Our results show that research training in low-resource settings needs a continuing and formal focus on the factors that hinder participants´ success: mentorship and time.","Wang Tiffany, Barter Shannon, Durieux Marcel, Flickinger Tabor, Twagirumugabe Theogene, Banguti Paulin",The Pan African medical journal,2021.0,34733389,PMC8531958,10.11604/pamj.2021.40.21.29191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34733389,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8531958,True,Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course - a modified SORT-IT model using blended learning with online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors,"Anesthesiology residents in Kigali, Rwanda","Completion of research projects, improved research knowledge, publication of papers, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange",True,"The blended SORT-IT model uses a combination of online modules and teleconferences with local and international mentors to teach operational research.

Mentoring Team Projects for the Doctor of Nursing Practice: Considerations for Nurse Anesthesia Faculty.,"The American Association of Colleges of Nursing and the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs have specified that Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Nursing Anesthesia Practice students complete a doctorate project as part of the education toward becoming Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists. As nurse anesthesia programs (NAPs) transition to DNP entry into practice, management of DNP projects has been identified as a major challenge facing nursing faculty. Also, adequate mentorship has been identified as a crucial part of doctorate education. Despite the absence of literature on team mentorship in nursing, many NAPs are opting for DNP team projects and group mentoring. In team DNP projects, the mentors foster professionalism, establish the ground rules for communication, resolve conflict, and provide expert knowledge. Eﬀective implementation of projects can enhance relational learning and teamwork, which are essential for a successful career in healthcare. Additionally, mentoring teams can simultaneously improve the professional growth of junior faculty, reduce the faculty workload, and improve the quality of DNP projects.

Residency Education Reform Program in Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care: An Academic Reform Model.,"Reform in medical education is a basic process in every academic department, especially in residency programs. This study was designed to assess the indices of education and research as part of the Medical Education Reform program (MERP) in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care (DACC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU) for four years. MERP in DACC, SBMU was designed and implemented as a modern academic reform model; different outcome measures in education and research were assessed to demonstrate the effects of the reform plan in academic improvements. there were significant improvements regarding education indices (i.e., teaching methods, passing comprehensive exams, mentorship, assessment methods, faculty development, professionalism in medical education, integration in education, and crisis management) and research indices (targeted research activities, innovation in research approaches, increasing the impact of research). Based on the experiences of DACC, SBMU regarding clinical anesthesiology residency, reform could be achieved using painstaking plans and continuous efforts with tangible documented outcomes.

"Empowering Women as Leaders in Pediatric Anesthesiology: Methodology, Lessons, and Early Outcomes of a National Initiative.","Research has shown that women have leadership ability equal to or better than that of their male counterparts, yet proportionally fewer women than men achieve leadership positions and promotion in medicine. The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) was founded within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) in 2018 as a multidimensional program to help address the significant career development, leadership, and promotion gender gap between men and women in anesthesiology. Herein, we describe WELI's development and implementation with an early assessment of effectiveness at 2 years. Members received an anonymous, voluntary survey by e-mail to assess whether they believed WELI was beneficial in several broad domains: career development, networking, project implementation and completion, goal setting, mentorship, well-being, and promotion and leadership. The response rate was 60.5% (92 of 152). The majority ranked several aspects of WELI to be very or extremely valuable, including the protégé-advisor dyads, workshops, nomination to join WELI, and virtual facilitated networking. For most members, WELI helped to improve optimism about their professional future. Most also reported that WELI somewhat or absolutely contributed to project improvement or completion, finding new collaborators, and obtaining invitations to be visiting speakers. Among those who applied for promotion or leadership positions, 51% found WELI to be somewhat or absolutely valuable to their application process, and 42% found the same in applying for leadership positions. Qualitative analysis of free-text survey responses identified 5 main themes: (1) feelings of empowerment and confidence, (2) acquisition of new skills in mentoring, coaching, career development, and project implementation, (3) clarification and focus on goal setting, (4) creating meaningful connections through networking, and (5) challenges from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the inability to sustain the advisor-protégé connection. We conclude that after 2 years, the WELI program has successfully supported career development for the majority of protégés and advisors. Continued assessment of whether WELI can meaningfully contribute to attainment of promotion and leadership positions will require study across a longer period. WELI could serve as a programmatic example to support women's career development in other subspecialties.","Schwartz Jamie McElrath, Markowitz Scott D, Yanofsky Samuel D, Tackett Sean, Berenstain Laura K, Schwartz Lawrence I, Flick Randall, Heitmiller Eugenie, Fiadjoe John, Lee Helen H, Honkanen Anita, Malviya Shobha, Cladis Franklyn P, Lee Jennifer K, Deutsch Nina",Anesthesia and analgesia,2021.0,34517375,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000005740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34517375,,True,"Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) - a multidimensional program including protégé-advisor dyads, workshops, and virtual facilitated networking",Women in pediatric anesthesiology,"Career development, leadership advancement, promotion, project implementation, networking, and addressing the gender gap in anesthesiology",True,"The Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative (WELI) was founded within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) in 2018 as a multidimensional program to help address the significant career development, leadership, and promotion gender gap between men and women in anesthesiology.

"Impact of Mentorship, by Gender, on Career Trajectory in an Academic Anesthesiology Department: A Survey Study.","Mentorship has been identified as a key component of success in business and in academic medicine. After institutional review board approval of the study, an email survey was sent to anesthesiologists in one anesthesiology department to assess mentorship status. A survey link was sent to nonrespondents at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. All participants were deidentified. The identification of a mentor was compared by gender, academic rank, and years of practice. Among 233 anesthesiologists, 103 (44.2%) responded to the survey. More than 90% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that having a mentor is important to career success. Of the 103 respondents, 31 (30%) indicated they had a mentor. Overall, 84% of the identified mentors were men; however, this percentage differed significantly between men and women respondents (95% versus 60%; P = .03). Characteristics associated with having a mentor included younger age (P = .007), fewer years since finishing training (P = .004), and working full time (P = .02). For respondent age and years since finishing training, there was some evidence that the association was dependent on the gender of the respondent (age-by-gender interaction, P = .08; experience-by-gender interaction, P = .08). Anesthesiologists in this department believed that mentorship led to more academic success. Few women mentors were reported, and women were unlikely to identify a mentor once advanced past an assistant professor rank. Most respondents believed that mentorship was important for overall career success, but only approximately one-third identified a mentor at the time of the survey.","Warner Lindsay L, Gali Bhargavi, Oxentenko Amy S, Schroeder Darrell R, Arendt Katherine W, Moeschler Susan M",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,2022.0,34459437,,10.1097/CEH.0000000000000378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34459437,,True,mentorship,anesthesiologists in an academic anesthesiology department,career success and academic advancement,True,Mentorship,Anesthesiologists in an academic department,More academic success and overall career success
"Mentorship in anesthesia: A perspective survey among anesthesia residents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Mentorship is an integral part of the professional and academic growth; however, the position of mentorships in anesthesia is still yet to be understood. As an attempt to understand this phenomenon, we targeted Riyadh Anesthesiology residents and program directors to explore their perception of mentorship relationships. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of mentorship in anesthesiology training and to assess the perspective of mentorship from anesthesiology residents. This was a cross-sectional study. We administered a 20-item validated cross-sectional survey to program directors and anesthesia residents to all Riyadh SCFHS anesthesiology departments. Residents were asked about their perceptions of barriers and benefits to effective mentoring. IBM SPSS version 23 and Microsoft Office Excel version 2010. Fifty anesthesiology residents and three program directors responded to our survey. The majority of residents agreed that mentorship was beneficial to the overall success as an anesthesiologist (36 of 50, 72%). Although all three program directors reported that a formal mentorship program is part of their residency program (3 of 3, 100%), only (25 of 50, 50%) responded with access to a mentor. Difficulties reported included lack of formalized meeting times, insufficient times with mentors, and mentor-mentee incompatibility. In conclusion, the study indicated the positive perspective and high principles to mentorship held by anesthesiology residents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It evidenced the beneficial, professional, and social impact that mentoring hails to the development of future anesthesiologists, and despite all that, it remains underutilized.","Bin Ghali Khalid N, AlSubaie Abdullah T, Nawab Azzam A",Saudi journal of anaesthesia,2021.0,34188632,PMC8191262,10.4103/sja.sja_1145_20,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34188632,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191262,True,mentorship program in anesthesiology residency,"anesthesiology residents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","professional and academic growth, overall success as an anesthesiologist",True,Mentorship program,"Anesthesiology residents and program directors in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Assess the prevalence of mentorship in anesthesiology training and to assess the perspective of mentorship from anesthesiology residents
Formation of an Anesthesiology Residency Mentoring Program Using a Mentee-Driven Approach.,"Mentorship is crucial to career development and advancement in academic medicine with valuable benefits to residents realized during training and beyond.

Closing the Mentorship Gap: Implementation of Speed Mentoring Events for Women Faculty and Trainees in Anesthesiology.,"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Mentorship is a key component to success in academic medicine. Women are under-represented in leadership positions within medicine. Women are less likely to identify mentors than men. Speed mentoring is an innovative strategy to facilitate mentorship in academic medicine. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> A speed mentoring event for women faculty members in an academic anesthesiology department was held, followed by a second event for trainees. Attendees completed surveys about mentorship experiences at baseline and in follow-up. Questions were rated on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree with values reported as median (1st, 3rd quartile). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Baseline surveys indicated poor satisfaction with mentoring in the prior 6 months as 4.5 (3, 5.25). Twelve months later, mentees reported increased satisfaction with mentoring 6 (6, 6). Mentors and mentees felt their time was well spent during both events. There was an increase in the number of mentors identified after the events by both groups. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our results suggest speed mentoring is well received and impactful with minimal time and monetary investment. The attendees of the events identified an increased number of mentors after speed mentoring events, and this effect was maintained at 6-12 months. Speed mentoring may be one path to providing support for women to advance their careers in academic medicine. More research is warranted to better evaluate effectiveness of formats such as speed mentoring to facilitate improved mentorship for women in academic anesthesiology.","Pollard E Morgan, Sharpe Emily E, Gali Bhargavi, Moeschler Susan M","Women's health reports (New Rochelle, N.Y.)",2021.0,33786528,PMC7935037,10.1089/whr.2020.0095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33786528,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935037,True,Speed mentoring events,Women faculty and trainees in anesthesiology,"Increased mentorship opportunities, improved satisfaction with mentoring, and career advancement for women in academic anesthesiology",True,Speed mentoring,Women faculty members and trainees in an academic anesthesiology department,"Increased satisfaction with mentoring, increased number of mentors identified, support for women to advance their careers in academic medicine"
Training the Trainer: Preparing Anesthesiology Residents to be Trainers in the Operating Room.,"The transition into clinical anesthesiology is a challenging period that requires swift acquisition of clinical knowledge and procedural skills. Senior residents are in a prime position to help their junior colleagues into the operating room environment due to their ability to relate from personal experience. We created a workshop for enhancing peer apprenticeship during this transition. The workshop consisted of PowerPoint didactics interspersed with small-group practice sessions. Surveys were administered pre-, post-, 1-week post-, and 1-month postworkshop. The primary outcome was pre-post improvement in the proportion of residents prepared to be a trainer. Secondary outcomes included pre- to 1-week postworkshop improvement, pre-postworkshop change in knowledge of learning theory concepts, and pre-postworkshop change in first-year clinical anesthesiology perceptions of trainers. Of residents, 12 of 43 (28%) eligible to be resident trainers attended the workshop. The proportion of residents who felt prepared increased from 75% preworkshop to 100% postworkshop and remained at 93% at 1 week. Knowledge of cognitive load and microskills improved from 0% preworkshop to 83% postworkshop but dropped to 0% at 1 month. Comfort using microskills improved from 0% preworkshop to 83% postworkshop. Early anesthesiology training demands rapid acquisition of novel cognitive and procedural skills. Senior anesthesiology residents are in a prime position to train junior residents, yet many are uncomfortable with this role. We developed a workshop to transition residents into a peer trainer role and significantly increased their confidence to be a trainer. Other programs may benefit from implementing similar training.","Huang Jeffrey, Licatino Lauren, Sims Charles R",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2021.0,33768148,PMC7970634,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768148,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970634,True,"Workshop for senior residents to enhance peer apprenticeship, consisting of PowerPoint didactics and small-group practice sessions focused on learning theory concepts and microskills",Senior anesthesiology residents who serve as trainers for junior residents transitioning into clinical anesthesiology,"Increased preparedness and confidence of senior residents to serve as trainers, improved knowledge of learning theory concepts, and enhanced training experience for junior residents entering the operating room environment",True,A workshop consisting of PowerPoint didactics interspersed with small-group practice sessions to enhance peer apprenticeship during the transition into clinical anesthesiology.,Senior anesthesiology residents,"Increased confidence and preparedness in senior residents to train junior residents, improved knowledge of cognitive load and microskills, and improved comfort using microskills."
Anesthesia Simulation Boot Camp-a Decade of Experience Enhancing Self-efficacy in First-year Residents.,"Novice anesthesiology residents must acquire new technical, cognitive, and behavioral skills as they transition into the high-stakes perioperative environment. Simulation-based education improves procedural skill and behavior, and it permits deliberate practice with feedback; exposure to uncommon, high-consequence events; assessment; reproducibility; and zero risk to patients. We introduced a 5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) in 2006 for first-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s) and report over a decade of experience assessing its impact on self-efficacy, value, feasibility, and sustainability. All CA-1s in our residency program participated in the SBC as part of orientation. Participants completed 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with a private debriefing session from an attending anesthesiologist in our simulation center. We measured their self-reported confidence, which we report as self-efficacy (SE), the belief in one's own ability to successfully execute a skill or behavior necessary for a desired outcome, for 25 basic anesthesia skills before and after course completion. Participants also completed a postcourse evaluation. Of the 281 CA-1s who participated in the course from 2006 to 2016, we collected data on 267 (95%). SE improved over the course of SBC for all 25 individual skills (<i>P</i> < .001) and remained stable over the decade-long period of study. Univariate analysis revealed a strong association between increased SE and male sex (<i>P</i> < .001), video gaming experience (<i>P</i> < .001), and completion of a prior residency (<i>P</i> = .018). Males were also more likely to report video gaming experience (<i>P</i> < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that although women had lower SE than did men, they had a greater increase in SE attributed to participation in SBC (<i>P</i> = .041). Participants strongly agreed SBC was a realistic and nonjudgmental learning tool, built confidence, and should be mandatory. Most comments were positive, reflecting overall satisfaction with SBC. SBC increases SE, is feasible, valuable to participants, and sustainable with remarkably consistency over the study period.","Miller Christina, Jackson Eric, Lee Benjamin, Gottschalk Allan, Schiavi Adam",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2020.0,33447652,PMC7792580,10.46374/volxxii-issue4-schiavi,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33447652,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792580,True,"5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) with 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with private debriefing from an attending anesthesiologist",First-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s),"Increased self-efficacy for basic anesthesia skills, improved confidence, and enhanced transition into the perioperative environment",True,"5-day, high-fidelity Simulation Boot Camp (SBC) with 2 individual high-fidelity simulations per day, each with a private debriefing session from an attending anesthesiologist",First-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-1s),"Improvement in self-efficacy for 25 basic anesthesia skills, increased confidence, and overall satisfaction with the SBC"
Methods of Orienting New Anesthesiology Residents to the Operating Room Environment: A National Survey of Residency Program Directors.,"The initial weeks of clinical anesthesiology are a formative period for new residents. Trainees may be clinically educated by a variety of individuals, and introductory didactic structure likely differs between institutions. This study was undertaken to define current orientation practices in US anesthesiology residency programs. A survey was created using Qualtrics© software and distributed to all US anesthesiology residency program directors through the Society of Academic Associations of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine email newsletter and through direct email to program directors. Fifty-six unique survey responses were received of 156 total programs. Eighty-nine percent of programs with an integrated intern year begin anesthesia-related orientation before the first year of clinical anesthesiology. Sixty-three percent of programs pair trainees with more than one specific individual during orientation. Programs most frequently pair trainees with anesthesiologists (75%) and/or senior residents (70%). Forty-six percent maintain this pairing for 4 weeks and 30% for 6 weeks or longer. Forty-three percent provide education on teaching practices to trainers. Introductory didactics last a median of 30 hours. Programs may blend lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, and/or checklists into a cohesive introductory curriculum. Fifty-six percent begin call responsibilities in the sixth week of orientation or later. Orientation practices for clinical anesthesia training vary across residency programs in the United States. We hope this information will help program directors compare their orientation practices to other programs and identify best practices and potentially useful variations.","Huang Jeffrey, Licatino Lauren K, Long Timothy R",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2020.0,33225015,PMC7664602,10.46374/volxxii-issue3-Licatino,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33225015,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664602,True,"Orientation practices including pairing trainees with anesthesiologists/senior residents, introductory didactics (lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, checklists), and gradual introduction to call responsibilities",New anesthesiology residents,Identifying best practices and potentially useful variations in orientation to help program directors improve their orientation practices,True,"Programs may blend lectures, simulations/workshops, digital content, problem-based learning, pocket references, and/or checklists into a cohesive introductory curriculum.

An Advanced Boot Camp for Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellows.,"Managing pediatric crises necessitates the acquisition of unique skills and confidence in its execution. Our aim was to develop and assess a curriculum based on the constructivist learning environment to enhance learning, orientation, and preparation of graduating pediatric anesthesiology fellows. Fifty pediatric anesthesiology fellows from 9 academic institutions in the United States were recruited for an advanced boot camp over a 2-year period. Training stations were developed using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions. The curriculum was evaluated using an anonymous survey that assessed knowledge, self-confidence, appropriateness of case-scenario complexity, and usefulness for transitioning into an independent practitioner on a Likert scale (<i>1 = strongly disagree</i> to <i>5 = strongly agree</i>). Data points were expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Ninety-eight percent of the fellows completed a survey. Fellow perceptions of the advanced boot camp was positive. The median scores (IQR) for knowledge, self-confidence, appropriateness of case complexity, and usefulness for transition in 2017 were 5 (3,5), 4.5 (3,5), 5 (3,5), and 5 (3,5), respectively, and 5 (3,5), 4.5 (3,5), 5 (4,5), and 5 (3,5), respectively, in 2018. The IQR in the assessment for an appropriate level of complexity for their level of training, narrowed in 2018 (4,5), when compared with 2017 (3,5). Fellow responses support the idea that the advanced boot camp provided tools and strategies for their transition. A narrowed IQR regarding the appropriate level of complexity of scenarios in 2018, when compared with 2017, might suggest an improvement in the curriculum.","Patel Shivani M, Singh Devika, Hunsberger Joann B, Lockman Justin L, Taneja Pravin A, Gurnaney Harshad G, Corridore Marco, Ambardekar Aditee P, Borzova Vera V, Vecchione Tricia M, Lockhart Thomas J, Lim Doyle J, Shay Joanne E, Black Stephanie A, Njoku Dolores B",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2020.0,32964069,PMC7489476,10.46374/volxxii-issue2-njoku,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32964069,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7489476,True,"Advanced boot camp curriculum using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions",Pediatric anesthesiology fellows,"Enhanced learning, orientation, and preparation for transitioning into independent practitioners",True,"An advanced boot camp using high-fidelity simulation, standardized patients, self-reflection modules, and facilitated discussions",Graduating pediatric anesthesiology fellows,"Enhanced knowledge, self-confidence, and preparation for transitioning into an independent practitioner"
Pediatric anesthesia training to early career stage: Opportunities for firm foundations.,"Attaining professional contentment can be challenging for many. Academic success, psychosocial support, and the confidence to provide excellent clinical care at the workplace are key pillars that can help build a sense of meaning in a career. The role of mentorship in facilitating these key pillars at different stages of pediatric anesthesia training and new independent practice is instrumental. For mentees aspiring for a career in pediatric anesthesia, there are several points of focus. Mentees should seek out mentors early in training, build on these relationships, and explore opportunities for peer mentorship as they advance in their career. For mentors, introducing mentees to the clinical and academic aspects of pediatric anesthesia and setting the foundation for the mentee to advance in their career can be both gratifying and stimulating. In this article, we explore the development and progression of a mentor-mentee relationship through training to the early career stage and its role in developing a meaningful career in pediatric anesthesia.","Munshey Farrukh, McDonnell Conor, Matava Clyde",Paediatric anaesthesia,2021.0,32726879,,10.1111/pan.13978,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32726879,,True,Mentorship throughout training and early career stages,Trainees and early career professionals in pediatric anesthesia,"Professional contentment, academic success, psychosocial support, clinical confidence, and meaningful career development in pediatric anesthesia",True,"Mentorship in facilitating key pillars of academic success, psychosocial support, and clinical care confidence.

The Rock of Gibraltar: The Value of Mentorship in the Early Years (Dr. Virginia Apgar and Dr. Ralph Waters).,"Behind every successful physician there are mentors to light the path. Ralph Waters, founder of the anesthesiology residency at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was an instrumental part of Virginia Apgar's success; his support of her education and promotion of her professional endeavors proved to shape the medical powerhouse that Apgar would become. In this article, we learn about the professional and personal relationship between Waters and Apgar through personal correspondence from the Ralph Waters Collection at University of Wisconsin Archives, scientific publications, and meeting records. Through his support of her career, she was able to achieve success despite the Great Depression, World War II, and the novelty of being a woman in medicine. In her career, Apgar became the first female full professor at Columbia University, designed and implemented the Apgar score, and led the Division of Congenital Malformations at the March of Dimes among many other accomplishments. Though they lived half of a country apart in Wisconsin and in New York, the mentor and mentee bridged the gap in geography through regular correspondence, American Society of Anesthetists (now American Society of Anesthesiologists) meetings (where Waters served as president and Apgar as treasurer), and exchange of trainees between the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Columbia University. Apgar revealed herself to be a persistent, hardworking, intelligent, and passionate academic physician - the perfect pupil for Waters.

East/West Visiting Scholars in Pediatric Anesthesia Program (ViSiPAP): Developing tomorrow's pediatric anesthesia leaders.,"Promoting and retaining junior faculty are major challenges for many medical schools. High clinical workloads often limit time for scholarly projects and academic development, especially in anesthesiology. To address this, we created the East/West Visiting Scholars in Pediatric Anesthesia Program (ViSiPAP). The program's goal is to help ""jumpstart"" academic careers by providing opportunities for national exposure and recognition through invited lectures and collaborative opportunities. East/West ViSiPAP benefits the participating scholars, the home and hosting anesthesia departments, and pediatric anesthesia fellowship training programs. By fostering a sense of well-being and inclusion in the pediatric anesthesia community, East/West ViSiPAP has the potential to increase job satisfaction, help faculty attain promotion, and reduce attrition. Faculty and trainees are exposed to new expertise and role models. Moreover, ViSiPAP provides opportunities for women and underrepresented in medicine faculty.

Pecha Kucha with Part-Task Training Improves Airway Management in Fresh Frozen Cadavers: A Case-Control Observational Study.,"The objective of this study was to ascertain whether the addition of part-task training as a step in Pecha Kucha for fiberoptic tracheal intubation increases the success rate and reduces the complication rate. The residents of the Department of Anesthesiology were initially included in an orientation program. We used the Pecha Kucha method for the presentation of teaching fiberoptic intubation skills. Afterwards the participants were trained in Laerdal® airway management and each participant performed tracheal intubation using the Aintree catheter. The participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 9) received part-task training and group 2 (n = 9) received whole-task training. The tracheal intubation performances of participants were evaluated on fresh frozen cadavers. The number of interventions, incidence of complications, success rate, and optimization maneuver requirements were recorded. Eighteen residents aged between 27 and 33 years were included. All were junior residents with less than 2 years of experience. There was no significant difference in terms of duration of tracheal intubation, complication rates, and optimization maneuvers between the study groups. Six participants could not place the tracheal tube in the last section. The success rates for the part-task group during Aintree and tracheal tube placement were 100 and 66.7%, respectively, whereas the rates were 55.6 and 44.4%, respectively, in whole-task group (p < 0.05).

Assessing the Efficacy of an Online Preoperative Evaluation Course for PGY-1 Anesthesiology Residents.,"The impact of an online postgraduate year (PGY-1) education program on anesthesiology resident knowledge base, anxiety, or preparedness has not been described previously. The literature shows resident knowledge of perioperative care is lower than expected. The Johns Hopkins Preoperative Evaluation and Anesthesia Course was designed as an 8 module, 8 month online academic curriculum for the program's PGY-1 class. Each module includes a pretest, topic synopsis, lecture video, moderated case discussion and a posttest. All PGY-1 residents entering the program in July 2012 were eligible to participate. Residents starting in July 2010 served as the control group. A survey was administered to measure self-assessed knowledge of and comfort with components of preoperative anesthesia care and perceived anxiety about starting the clinical anesthesia year. Additional outcome measures included performance on the pretest and postmodule tests and Anesthesia Knowledge Test scores from day 1 of Clinical Anesthesia year 1 (CA-1, PGY-2) orientation. Statistical analysis included independent t tests, the Mann-Whitney test, and sensitivity analyses. Residents in the intervention group showed an improvement of 16.25 to 39.60 percentage points between the pretest and posttest in each of the 8 subjects (P < .0001 in every subject). The intervention group median score was 24 percentile points higher on the Anesthesia Knowledge Test as compared with the control group (P = .0488; lower 95% CI, 9.92). Significant improvement was also seen across measures including comfort advising about medications (P < .0001), understanding of coexisting disease (P < .0001), comfort assessing patient airway (P = .0002), and anxiety about starting PGY-2 year (P = .0116).

Transition to Practice in Anesthesiology: Survey Results of Practicing Anesthesiologists on Their Experience.,"To assess the experiences and attitudes of practicing anesthesiologists on practice/business management training received during residency and transitioning to practice through an online survey. An online survey, consisting of 39 questions developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Young Physicians, was emailed to 2 6551 practicing US anesthesiologists who were ASA members. Questions about individuals' demographic information, transition to practice (TTP) experiences, medical business training, and TTP curricula in residency were included. Results were reported as descriptive statistics. A total of 1199 responses were obtained (response rate 4.5%), and68% reported working in private practice over an average of 17 years. Those practicing ≤ 10 years were more likely to have a TTP curriculum in residency compared to those in practice ≥ 11 years. Common problems reported by many participants regarding TTP included: lack of effective mentorship, inadequate residency curricula/education, and an unfamiliarity with available resources. Although medical business practice education is now required by training programs, there is room for improvement in education. One potential solution is establishing TTP curricula in residency programs, which emphasize the business aspects of medicine and practice management, thus easing trainees from a training to practice environment.","Kuza Catherine M, Harbell Monica W, Malinzak Elizabeth B, Goff Kristina L, Bicket Mark C, Ifeanyi-Pillette Ifey C, Wong Becky J, Khanna Ashish K",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2019.0,31988980,PMC6972967,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31988980,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972967,True,Transition to Practice (TTP) curricula in residency programs that emphasize business aspects of medicine and practice management,Anesthesiology residents/trainees,"Easing transition from training to practice environment, addressing lack of effective mentorship, inadequate residency education, and unfamiliarity with resources",True,"Establishing Transition to Practice (TTP) curricula in residency programs, emphasizing the business aspects of medicine and practice management",Practicing US anesthesiologists who are ASA members,"Easing trainees from a training to practice environment, improvement in education regarding medical business practice"
[INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE INTERNSHIP YEAR].,"To describe three interventions that have improved the quality of the internship. All medical school graduates are required to take a one year internship, rotating through various hospital departments. By various objective and subjective measures, the quality, benefit and efficacy of the internship varies significantly between departments and hospitals and also depends on where the interns studied. The interventions were: First, all graduates of foreign medical schools (FMG) were required to interview and present a patient, demonstrating practical knowledge of spoken and written Hebrew and basic medical terminology prior to the start of the internship. Second, on the first day of their internship in internal medicine the new interns participate in an orientation day, addressing multiple clinical, administrative and other components. Third, upon the completion of their rotation in internal medicine, the interns participate in an interactive session to help them prepare for their future career. First, during the first 3 years after introducing the Hebrew test, 101 FMGs took the test, 89 (88%) passed the first time, the remainder passed the 2nd or 3rd test after another 1-3 months of studying Hebrew. Of 31 women, 30 (97%) passed the first time, compared to 59/70 (84%) of the men (p=0.065); 27/28 (96%) of Jewish interns passed the first time compared to 62/73 (85%) non-Jewish interns (p=0.99). Physicians report on the significantly increased ability of FMGs to participate in all activities from the onset of their internship. Second, upon completion of the orientation, 137 interns provided feedback of its 12 components; satisfaction was marked on a Likert scale (ranging from 1 [low] to 5 [high]) and ranged from 4.2±0.1 to 4.7±0.6; high/very high satisfaction with the various components ranged from 79% to 96%. Third, feedback was provided by 96 interns after participating in the interactive session helping to prepare for the future; satisfaction with the 5 components of the session ranged from 3.8±0.8 (on the acquired insight into the possibilities, scope and limitations regarding their future career) to 4.5±0.7 (regarding the relevance of such sessions). Sub-analysis revealed several statistically significant differences between male and female interns (male interns indicated these sessions to be more important to them than females, p<0.01), and FMG (as compared to graduates from Israeli medical schools) indicated that they had acquired relevant information more often (p<0.001). Various interventions positively impact the quality, benefit and efficacy of the internship as observed by physicians working with the residents, as well as perceived by the interns themselves.","Schwartz Yuval, Weigert Nir, Cohen Asaf, Steinmetz Yoed, Ioscovich Alexander, Yinnon Amos M, Munter Gabriel",Harefuah,2019.0,31576706,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31576706,,True,"Three interventions: 1) Hebrew language proficiency testing for foreign medical graduates, 2) Orientation day for new interns in internal medicine, 3) Interactive career preparation session upon completion of internal medicine rotation","Medical interns, particularly foreign medical graduates","Improved quality, benefit and efficacy of internship experience",True,"Three interventions were used: 1) Requiring all graduates of foreign medical schools to interview and present a patient, demonstrating practical knowledge of spoken and written Hebrew and basic medical terminology prior to the start of the internship. 2) On the first day of their internship in internal medicine the new interns participate in an orientation day, addressing multiple clinical, administrative and other components. 3) Upon the completion of their rotation in internal medicine, the interns participate in an interactive session to help them prepare for their future career.",Graduates of foreign medical schools starting their internship in internal medicine.,"Improved quality, benefit and efficacy of the internship as observed by physicians working with the residents, as well as perceived by the interns themselves."
Opportunities and challenges for junior investigators conducting pain clinical trials.,"Clinical investigation serves a vital role to advance treatment and management stratgies for patients with pain. For those new to clinical investigation, key advice for both the novice clinical-investigator and the experienced researcher expanding to translational work may accelerate research efforts. To review foundational material relevant to junior investigators focusing on pain clinical trials, with an emphasis on randomized controlled trials. We reviewed recent publications and resources relevant to clinical investigators, with a particular emphasis on pain research. Understanding the approaches and barriers to clinical pain research is a first step to building a successful investigative portfolio. Key components of professional development include motivation, mentorship, and collaborative approaches to research. Many junior clinical-investigators face challenges in pursing research careers and sparking iterative progress towards success in clinical trials. Pain-specific research metrics and goals-including hypothesis development, study design considerations, and regulatory concerns-are also important considerations to junior investigators who pursue clinical trails. Approaches to build toward collaborative and independent funding are essential for investigators. This work provides a foundation for understanding the clinical research process and helps inform the goals and plans of clinical-investigators.","Adams Meredith C B, Bicket Mark C, Murphy Jamie D, Wu Christopher L, Hurley Robert W",Pain reports,2019.0,31372584,PMC6675408,10.1097/PR9.0000000000000639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31372584,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6675408,True,Mentorship and collaborative approaches to research for junior investigators conducting pain clinical trials,Junior investigators focusing on pain clinical trials,"Accelerated research efforts, successful investigative portfolio, and progress toward collaborative and independent funding",True,"Professional development including motivation, mentorship, and collaborative approaches to research.

Improving the Training Process of Anesthesiology Residents Through the Mentorship-Based Approach.,"Although mentoring has been accepted as an effective and nourishing component in medical learning, known mentoring programs for the residents are lacking in most countries. To evaluate the mentoring program for anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University, an examination was designed to explore the styles of mentoring programs, as well as the aims and outcome followed by such programs. In October 2016, Anesthesiology Department of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences enrolled all the nine educational wards in ""mentorship program"". Twelve members of the faculty were chosen to be mentor. This program contained: (a) Creating online groups for reporting, feedbacks, and problem-solving, (b) integrating each chapter of textbooks for studying program each month, (c) establishing formative and summative assessments (i.e., PMP, OSCE, multiple choice exams), (d) role-playing for stress management of level 4 residents. Our main objective was to provide the residents with the provision of mentors. The goals of our programs were: Arrange a safe environment to encourage and foster reflection, promote self-care and wellness, guide special development, provide a resource for residents pursuing control, enrich team constructing and problem-solving skills, and promotion in career counseling of anesthesia residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences enrolled in this program from 2014 to 2017. We retrospectively compared 2 periods before (2014 - 2015) and after (2016 - 2017) of monthly examination and educational conference. In the academic stage from 2014 - 2015, the overall first-time license rate for the IBA written QE was 7 of 14 (50%) and in the period of 2016 - 2017, the general rate was 11 of 14 (78%) and in the period of 2017 - 2018, it was 12 of 14 (85%). For each extra year experiencing the program, the odds ratio for passing IBA written QE was 1.7 (P < 0.05). The median Iranian Board of Anesthesiology In-Training Examination (IBAITE) percentile was considerably greater in period 2 than period 1 (P < 0.05). Also, there was a significant correlation between IBAITE score and first-time passing rates for the IBA written QE (0.55, P < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrated the clinical mentorship program as an effective method in improving theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents. Programmed mentorship could significantly improve the educational goal achievements for anesthesiology residents. Mentoring programs are needed to be more used; however, need to be assessed and evaluated, especially regarding the professional aspects of education. Medical schools could subsequently be assessed regarding the number and quality of their running mentorship programs as a quality improvement tool.","Dabbagh Ali, Massoudi Nilofar, Vosoghian Maryam, Mottaghi Kamran, Mirkheshti Alireza, Tajbakhsh Ardeshir, Sezari Parissa, Moshari Mohammadreza, Tabashi Soodeh",Anesthesiology and pain medicine,2019.0,30881915,PMC6412912,10.5812/aapm.88657,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30881915,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6412912,True,"Mentorship-based approach including online groups for reporting and feedback, integrated textbook study programs, formative and summative assessments, and role-playing for stress management",Anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,"Improved theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents, increased passing rates for board examinations, and enhanced educational goal achievements",True,"Mentorship program that includes creating online groups for reporting, feedbacks, and problem-solving, integrating each chapter of textbooks for studying program each month, establishing formative and summative assessments, and role-playing for stress management.",Anesthesiology residents at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,"Improvement in theoretical, clinical, and professional achievement of anesthesiology residents, promotion in career counseling, enrichment of team constructing and problem-solving skills, and significant improvement in the educational goal achievements for anesthesiology residents."
Faculty-Focused Perioperative Ultrasound Training Program: A Single-Center Experience.,"Comprehensive educational initiatives in ultrasound for practicing physicians are lacking. We developed a perioperative ultrasound training program for faculty to offer a broad orientation to the principles and clinical applications of ultrasound. The program consisted of two phases. Phase one, which introduced ultrasound via didactic and hands-on components, had six live sessions. At the end of each, participants completed a knowledge quiz. During the sixth session, faculty participated in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). For phase two, faculty attended two to three sessions (8-10 hours each) of in-depth individualized training and demonstrated supervised performance of ultrasound-related procedures of their choice. Participants included Anesthesia faculty at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. On average 30 faculty members attended each live session for phase one; 12 completed phase two. There was a significant difference in quiz scores across the six sessions (p < 0.001) with scores for Session 6 being significantly higher than for Session 1 (p < 0.001). The average mean and median scores on the three OSCE stations were 95.63% and 98.33%, respectively. For phase two, the 8 participants who received training in regional anesthesia each performed > 10 blocks on patients over two days; 5 of the 7 participants who received training in transthoracic echocardiography each completed more than 15 examinations on simulators and 10 examinations on patients. It is possible to implement a departmental educational program for ultrasound to improve ultrasound knowledge and skills in practicing anesthesiologists.","Matyal Robina, Mitchell John D, Mahmood Feroze, Oren-Grinberg Achikam, Leibowitz Akiva, Amador Yannis, Wong Vanessa, Khamooshian Arash, Mahmood Faraz, Amir Rabia, Bortman Jeffrey, Jones Stephanie B",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2019.0,30638919,,10.1053/j.jvca.2018.12.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30638919,,True,"Two-phase perioperative ultrasound training program with didactic sessions, hands-on components, knowledge quizzes, OSCE, and individualized training with supervised performance",Anesthesia faculty at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Improved ultrasound knowledge and skills in practicing anesthesiologists,True,"A perioperative ultrasound training program consisting of two phases.

Learning Preferences of First-Year Anesthesiology Residents During Their Orientation Month: A Single-Institution Study.,"As a step toward understanding whether learning preferences may benefit trainees and instructors, we studied the learning preferences, based on the VARK questionnaire, of anesthesiology residents during their orientation month to determine whether knowing their preferences influenced the educational resources they used. While resource utilization was similar for residents who knew their preferences and those who did not, residents overall used aural and read/write resources frequently. The learning preferences of 13 residents (72.2%) changed during the month. While further research is needed, this study provides insight into anesthesiology residents' learning styles.","Eosakul Stanley T, Wong Vanessa, Ku Cindy M, Mitchell John D",A&A practice,2019.0,30134254,,10.1213/XAA.0000000000000880,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30134254,,True,Studying learning preferences using VARK questionnaire during orientation month,First-year anesthesiology residents,Understanding whether learning preferences influence educational resource utilization,True,Understanding learning preferences based on the VARK questionnaire,First-year anesthesiology residents during their orientation month,Influence on the educational resources used by residents
A Program Director Survey of the Clinical Base Year in Anesthesiology Residency Programs.,"To maintain compliance with the current shift towards competency-based milestone assessment in graduate medical education, residency training programs must reflect this emphasis in their curricula starting with the intern year of training.1 In working towards collaborative efforts in curricular development between Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) anesthesiology residency programs, understanding the structure and design of the clinical base year for anesthesiology residency programs nationwide will serve as a valuable initial step. Anonymous online surveys were sent to anesthesiology residency program directors to collect data regarding their program's anesthesiology clinical base year (CBY) required, elective, and novel rotations. The survey was also designed to characterize the educational resources provided by the department, changes in the design of the clinical base year, and the feedback received from interns or other rotation department heads. Thirty-nine out of 130 US anesthesiology residency program directors responded (30%). The majority of respondents (87%) provide an in-house categorical intern CBY with a majority of those (94%) including a month dedicated to anesthesiology, during which some form of mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff was provided. The majority of respondents with anesthesiology exposure stated that they provide educational resources such as textbook materials (82%) or simulation sessions (89%) to their residents. With the evolution of the role of the anesthesiologist, advancements in biotechnology, and newly created board examinations, it is imperative that the CBY prepares rising anesthesiology residents to meet these demands. Results from this survey study can serve as the initial step in improving the clinical base year structure for anesthesiology residents nationally. Collaborative efforts can be undertaken to better incorporate clinical competency, feedback mechanisms, and educational tools through the collection of experiential evidence of successful strategies as well as challenges faced by program directors nationwide.","Streiff Agathe, Orlando Barbara, Mahoney Bryan",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2018.0,29928666,PMC5993005,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29928666,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993005,True,"Mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff during a dedicated anesthesiology month in the clinical base year, with educational resources including textbook materials and simulation sessions",Anesthesiology interns/residents in their clinical base year,"Better preparation of rising anesthesiology residents through improved clinical base year structure incorporating clinical competency, feedback mechanisms, and educational tools",True,The onboarding strategy includes a month dedicated to anesthesiology with mentorship by anesthesiology faculty or senior house staff.

Are Short Subspecialty Courses the Educational Answer?,"There is an urgent need to train more anesthesia providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is also a need to provide more educational opportunities in subspecialty areas of anesthetic practice such as trauma management, pain management, obstetric anesthesia, and pediatric anesthesia. Together, these subspecialty areas make up a large proportion of the clinical workload in LMICs. In these countries, the quality of education may be variable, there may be few teachers, and opportunities for continued learning and mentorship are rare. Short subspecialty courses such as Primary Trauma Care, Essential Pain Management, Safer Anaesthesia From Education-Obstetric Anaesthesia, and Safer Anaesthesia From Education-Paediatric Anaesthesia have been developed to help fill this need. They have the potential for immediate impact by providing an opportunity for continuing professional development and relevant subspecialty training. These courses are all short (1-3 days), are presented as an off-the-shelf package, and include a teach-the-teacher component. They use a variety of interactive teaching techniques and are designed to be adaptable and responsive to local needs. There is an emphasis on local ownership of the educational process that helps to promote sustainability. After an initial financial outlay to purchase equipment, the costs are relatively low. Short subspecialty courses appear to be part of the educational answer in LMICs, but there is a need for research to validate their role.","Evans Faye M, Duarte Juan C, Haylock Loor Carolina, Morriss Wayne",Anesthesia and analgesia,2018.0,29547425,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000002664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29547425,,True,"Short subspecialty courses (1-3 days) with teach-the-teacher components, using interactive teaching techniques and adaptable to local needs","Anesthesia providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) needing subspecialty training in trauma management, pain management, obstetric anesthesia, and pediatric anesthesia","Immediate impact on continuing professional development, relevant subspecialty training, local ownership of educational process, and sustainability of anesthesia education",True,"Short subspecialty courses such as Primary Trauma Care, Essential Pain Management, Safer Anaesthesia From Education-Obstetric Anaesthesia, and Safer Anaesthesia From Education-Paediatric Anaesthesia.

The role of feedback in ameliorating burnout.,"Assessment of the current literature surrounding interventions directed toward the prevention of burnout in the field of medicine and particularly in anesthesiology. Recently, burnout has been noted to lead to medication errors and subsequently increased harm to our patients. On a personal level, burnout can lead to depression and even suicide amongst physicians. Strategies to prevent burnout amongst anesthesiologists that have been studied in the literature include multisource feedback, mentorship and early recognition. There remains no clear or definitive intervention to prevent burnout for physicians. However, changing our environment to embrace mentorship, the continual exchange of feedback and the fostering self-care could startlingly improve our work environment.","Gordon Emily K, Baranov Dimitry Y, Fleisher Lee A",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2018.0,29461263,,10.1097/ACO.0000000000000583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29461263,,True,mentorship and multisource feedback,anesthesiologists,"prevention of burnout, improved work environment, reduction in medication errors",True,"multisource feedback, mentorship and early recognition",anesthesiologists,"prevention of burnout, improvement of work environment"
Safe Surgery for All: Early Lessons from Implementing a National Government-Driven Surgical Plan in Ethiopia.,"Recognizing the unmet need for surgical care in Ethiopia, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) has pioneered innovative methodologies for surgical system development with Saving Lives through Safe Surgery (SaLTS). SaLTS is a national flagship initiative designed to improve access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system. Sustained commitment from the FMOH and their recruitment of implementing partners has led to notable accomplishments across the breadth of the surgical system, including but not limited to: (1) Leadership, management and governance-a nationally scaled surgical leadership and mentorship programme, (2) Infrastructure-operating room construction and oxygen delivery plan, (3) Supplies and logistics-a national essential surgical procedure and equipment list, (4) Human resource development-a Surgical Workforce Expansion Plan and Anaesthesia National Roadmap, (5) Advocacy and partnership-strong FMOH partnership with international organizations, including GE Foundation's SafeSurgery2020 initiative, (6) Innovation-facility-driven identification of problems and solutions, (7) Quality of surgical and anaesthesia care service delivery-a national peri-operative guideline and WHO Surgical Safety Checklist implementation, and (8) Monitoring and evaluation-a comprehensive plan for short-term and long-term assessment of surgical quality and capacity. As Ethiopia progresses with its commitment to prioritize surgery within its Health Sector Transformation Plan, disseminating the process and outcomes of the SaLTS initiative will inform other countries on successful national implementation strategies. The following article describes the process by which the Ethiopian FMOH established surgical system reform and the preliminary results of implementation across these eight pillars.","Burssa Daniel, Teshome Atlibachew, Iverson Katherine, Ahearn Olivia, Ashengo Tigistu, Barash David, Barringer Erin, Citron Isabelle, Garringer Kaya, McKitrick Victoria, Meara John, Mengistu Abraham, Mukhopadhyay Swagoto, Reynolds Cheri, Shrime Mark, Varghese Asha, Esseye Samson, Bekele Abebe",World journal of surgery,2017.0,29030677,,10.1007/s00268-017-4271-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29030677,,True,National surgical leadership and mentorship programme,Surgical and anesthesia providers in Ethiopia,"Improved access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system",True,"Surgical leadership and mentorship programme, Surgical Workforce Expansion Plan and Anaesthesia National Roadmap","Healthcare system in Ethiopia, specifically surgical and anaesthesia care","Improved access to safe, essential and emergency surgical and anaesthesia care across all levels of the healthcare system"
Career Development Guidance and Mentorship during Anesthesia Residency Training: An Internet Survey.,"We conducted a survey of Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States to identify current practice regarding mentorship and teaching of topics related to career development. Program directors for all currently accredited Anesthesiology residency programs (N=129 as of April 2016) were contacted by e-mail and invited to complete a short internet survey. Two follow-up e-mails were sent at one-week intervals to those who had not yet responded. 59 program directors responded, yielding 53 complete responses, for an adjusted response rate of 41.1%. Program and practice management type (university versus other, hospital versus private) were not strongly associated with presence of a career development curriculum (CDC). In general, larger residency programs (30 or more residents) and university-based programs were more likely to provide lectures on specific CDC topics. Whether residency program directors agreed or disagreed with the premise that instruction should be provided on other topics besides anesthesia, was unrelated to the presence of CDC in their programs. The results of this survey demonstrate that the establishment of a mentorship program (even a rudimentary one) may be the first step in creating a CDC. Apart from having a CDC program already in place, the strongest predictor of CDC content was the size of the residency program. Though there are training programs that openly stated on our survey that they do not have a CDC in place, some of these programs still provided lectures on one or more of the topics surveyed.","Gupta Ruchir, Reinsel Ruth",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,2017.0,28884135,PMC5581964,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28884135,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5581964,True,Mentorship programs and career development curriculum (CDC) for anesthesiology residents,Anesthesiology residents in training programs in the United States,Better career development guidance and preparation for anesthesiology residents,True,Establishment of a mentorship program and career development curriculum,Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States,"Provision of lectures on specific career development topics, especially in larger and university-based programs"
Junior faculty core curriculum to enhance faculty development.,"Senior Instructors and Assistant Professors in their first academic appointment may not have all the tools for an efficient start to their careers. Although many institutions provide access to mentoring programs and seminars on faculty development, the timing and format of the offerings often conflict with ongoing responsibilities of the faculty, particularly clinical faculty. We established a collaboration between the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and the University of Rochester Medical Center Office for Faculty Development with the goal of developing a week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum that would better suit faculty schedules. We convened focus groups and with their help, identified themes for inclusion in the course. Speakers were identified from among local senior faculty. University leadership was enlisted in promoting the course. Individual speakers and course content were evaluated daily, at the end of the week-long course, and 6 months later. Planning for subsequent years incorporated the feedback. Yearly evaluations and subsequent course modification continued. Junior faculty from nearly every department in the Medical Center were represented. There was high learner satisfaction and participation however several limitations were identified and addressed in subsequent years. The focus on principles and available resources, not specific skills or content was appropriate. Daily interactions among participants from a wide variety of departments fostered networking among faculty who may not otherwise have met and discussed common interests. The ultimate value of such an early, intensive faculty development program will depend on whether it equips junior faculty to organize, develop, and achieve their academic goals better than alternative formats. This will require further study.","Guillet Ronnie, Holloway Robert G, Gross Robert A, Libby Katie, Shapiro Janine R",Journal of clinical and translational science,2017.0,28649448,PMC5471817,10.1017/cts.2016.29,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28649448,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5471817,True,Week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum with daily sessions covering faculty development themes,Junior faculty (Senior Instructors and Assistant Professors) in their first academic appointment,"Better equipped faculty to organize, develop, and achieve academic goals; enhanced networking among faculty from different departments",True,"A week-long Junior Faculty Core Curriculum that suits faculty schedules, with focus on principles and available resources, not specific skills or content.

Preliminary study of a teaching model for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade and effects on the learning curve in veterinary anesthesia residents.,"To evaluate the use of an experimental colloid model for teaching veterinary anesthesia residents ultrasound-guided technique for nerve blockade. Prospective, blinded and randomized. Colloid models were constructed for practice in ultrasound-guided needle location. Nine veterinary anesthesia residents with no prior experience of ultrasound-guided technique for nerve blocks were randomly divided into three groups. Each group received theoretical orientation. Two groups were assigned to practical training using the experimental model: group 1 (G1) received 2 hours of training and group 2 (G2) received 1 hour of training prior to testing with specific tasks. Group 3 (G3) received no practical training. During testing, the time required for task completion (e.g., display of structures and positioning a needle) and the number of failures were recorded. The average times to completion of the tasks and the number of technical failures were: G1, 47 seconds and 1 failure; G2, 68 seconds and 2 failures; G3, 187 seconds and 7 failures. In residents with no prior experience of ultrasound-guided needle placement, using an experimental colloid model and a longer training period was associated with increased accuracy and decreased time to task completion. Based on the results of this study, training with an experimental model can be recommended to improve the speed and accuracy of needle manipulation using ultrasound in clinicians with no prior experience of ultrasound-guided technique.","da Silva Luciano C B A, Sellera Fábio P, Gargano Ronaldo G, Rossetto Thais C, Gomes Giancarlo B, Miyahira Fabiano T, Futema Fábio, Cortopassi Silvia R G",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,2017.0,28262499,,10.1016/j.vaa.2016.08.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28262499,,True,Training with an experimental colloid model for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade technique,Veterinary anesthesia residents with no prior experience of ultrasound-guided technique for nerve blocks,Improved speed and accuracy of needle manipulation using ultrasound,True,Use of an experimental colloid model for teaching ultrasound-guided technique for nerve blockade.

Mentorship in anesthesia: a survey of perspectives among Canadian anesthesia residents.,"Mentorship is important for professional and academic growth; however, the role of mentorship in anesthesia is still being defined. We surveyed Canadian anesthesia residents to explore their perceptions of mentorship relationships. We administered a 20-item cross-sectional survey to program directors and anesthesia residents in all Canadian departments of anesthesia. Program directors were asked about their mentorship programs, and residents were asked about their perceptions of benefits and barriers to effective mentoring. Sixteen of 17 (94%) program directors and 189 of 585 (32%) anesthesia residents responded to our survey. While 143 of 180 (79%) residents agreed that mentorship was beneficial to overall success as an anesthesiologist, only 11 of 16 (69%) program directors reported formal mentorship as part of their residency program, and only 119 of 189 (63%) residents reported access to a mentor. Barriers reported by residents included insufficient time with mentors, lack of formalized meeting times and objectives, mentor-mentee incompatibility (personal or professional), and lack of resident choice in mentor selection. Our study confirms that, despite positive perceptions among residents, mentorship remains underutilized in anesthesia programs. We identify barriers to effective mentorship, including the need to consider resident choice as a means to improve formal anesthesia mentorship programs.","Ergun Suzan, Busse Jason W, Wong Anne",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2017.0,28092066,,10.1007/s12630-017-0816-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28092066,,True,formal mentorship programs in anesthesia residency,Canadian anesthesia residents,"improved professional and academic growth, overall success as an anesthesiologist",True,Mentorship programs,Canadian anesthesia residents,"Improved success as an anesthesiologist, overcoming barriers such as insufficient time with mentors, lack of formalized meeting times and objectives, mentor-mentee incompatibility, and lack of resident choice in mentor selection"
A qualitative exploration of anesthesia trainees' experiences during transition to a children's hospital.,"The stresses of starting a new job can make anyone feel tired and inefficient. In health care, this may impair the ability to learn at a time when there is most to learn, and increase the risk of error in a context where errors may lead to patient harm. The aim of this study was to understand issues which influence anesthesia trainees' transition to a pediatric setting. This qualitative study utilized in-depth semi-structured interviews to gather data from 31 anesthesia trainees who had commenced work at a tertiary children's hospital between 4 and 6 weeks previously. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Two key themes were identified: feeling ineffective, which appeared to have both a cognitive component (feeling disoriented) and an emotional component (feeling useless), and feeling anxious or afraid. Trainees found the pediatric environment highly unfamiliar, which made them feel disoriented, inefficient, and at times incompetent. Many experienced difficulty identifying a useful role in a highly specialized area of practice, leading to loss of identity as an expert clinician. Many described an ever-present fear of making an anesthetic error or being unable to manage a rapidly evolving clinical situation. Some trainees developed a negative mindset, which was reinforced by subsequent perceived failures. Overall, these experiences impeded trainees' ability to concentrate and learn. The impact of disorientation and anxiety on anesthesia trainees as they adapt to a highly specialized clinical environment such as a children's hospital should not be underestimated. Study findings illustrate the importance of helping new trainees to feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in assessing their own performance during the transition period.","Howe Peter W, Kumar Koshila",Paediatric anaesthesia,2017.0,27878890,,10.1111/pan.13064,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27878890,,True,qualitative study exploring transition experiences to identify issues affecting anesthesia trainees during onboarding,anesthesia trainees transitioning to a tertiary children's hospital,"understanding factors that impede learning and performance during transition to inform better onboarding approaches that help trainees feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in self-assessment",True,Not specified in the abstract,Anesthesia trainees who had commenced work at a tertiary children's hospital,"Helping new trainees to feel less afraid, more useful, and more realistic in assessing their own performance during the transition period"
Anesthesiology Resident Wellness Program at the University of Saskatchewan: concept and development.,"We describe the need for an anesthesiology resident wellness program (ARWP) and the challenges associated with its development and implementation. We also present the results of a preliminary program evaluation. We conducted a needs assessment of Canadian anesthesiology residency programs for a formal ARWP. This endeavor involved both a cross-sectional survey and a focus group of Canadian anesthesiology residency training program directors (PDs). Following the development and implementation of an ARWP at our own university, we conducted an evaluation. The quantitative data are reported using descriptive statistics. Common themes were generated from qualitative data through an iterative process. Among the 18 PDs across Canada, 10 (56%) responded to the needs assessment. The PDs identified that resident wellness was important to the delivery of their programs but that very few had a formal wellness curriculum. This informed the further development of the ARWP over two years to comprise a Modular Curriculum, a Peer Support Curriculum, Self-Directed Learning Activities, and a Department Wellness Program. Online evaluation of the ARWP was completed by 28 of 31 (90%) of our anesthesiology residents, who reported high levels of satisfaction with the ARWP, the relevance of the topics, and the applicability of skills and information to both work and daily life. Respondents identified Team Building Activities, Mentorship and Orientation, Resident Wellness Nights, and Transitions to Practice Night as the most valuable components of the ARWP. After identifying the need for a formal ARWP in Canada, we implemented one at the University of Saskatchewan. We found high levels of overall resident satisfaction with the program.","Chakravarti Anita, Raazi Mateen, O'Brien Jennifer, Balaton Breanna",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2017.0,27848199,,10.1007/s12630-016-0772-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848199,,True,Anesthesiology Resident Wellness Program (ARWP) which includes Mentorship and Orientation as one of its components,Anesthesiology residents at the University of Saskatchewan,Improved resident wellness and satisfaction,True,"The ARWP includes a Modular Curriculum, a Peer Support Curriculum, Self-Directed Learning Activities, and a Department Wellness Program.

[Anesthesia for medical students : A brief guide to practical anesthesia in adults with a web-based video illustration].,"In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, anesthesiologists are the second largest group of physicians in hospitals, but this does not correspond to the amount of anesthesiology teaching that medical students receive in medical schools. Accordingly, the chances of medical students recognizing anesthesiology as a promising personal professional career are smaller than in other disciplines with large teaching components. Subsequent difficulties to recruit anesthesiology residents are likely, although many reasons support anesthesiology as a professional career.Traditional strategies to teach medical students in anesthesiology in medical school consist of airway management or cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts in manikins. Anesthesiology is a complex interaction consisting of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, clinical evaluation, experience, knowledge, and manual skills. While some medical schools offer teaching in high fidelity simulators, clinical teaching in the operating room is often limited. When medical students opt for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology, there is a chance to demonstrate the fascinating world of anesthesiology, but this chance has to be utilized carefully by anesthesiologists, as young talents have to be discovered, supported, and challenged.We have put together a short guide for medical students for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology in adults in order to generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology as well as a sense of achievement. Basic knowledge about premedication, induction, maintenance and strategies for anesthesia is discussed. Further, the most important anesthesia drugs are discussed and manual skills, such as intravenous cannulation, mask ventilation, intubation, and regional anesthesia are featured with QR-code based video illustrations on a smartphone or personal computer. We did not discuss possible local mannerism and special patient groups (e. g., children, special medical history), local guidelines, or standard operating procedures.Medical students can be inspired by anesthesiology when not simply told about the tools of the trade and strategies, but instead by gaining knowledge and clinical skills that render a sense of achievement, likely during a clinical rotation into anesthesiology. A short theoretical instruction of anesthesiology enables rapid and targeted orientation even before a clinical rotation. Whether this subsequently results in a higher recruiting chance is currently unknown.","Mathis S, Schlafer O, Abram J, Kreutziger J, Paal P, Wenzel V",Der Anaesthesist,2016.0,27787571,,10.1007/s00101-016-0231-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27787571,,True,"A brief guide for medical students during clinical rotation in anesthesiology, including basic knowledge about premedication, induction, maintenance, anesthesia strategies, important drugs, and manual skills with QR-code based video illustrations",Medical students during clinical rotation in anesthesiology,"Generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology, provide a sense of achievement, and potentially improve recruitment of anesthesiology residents",True,"Short guide for medical students for a clinical rotation in anesthesiology in adults to generate basic knowledge and interest in anesthesiology as well as a sense of achievement.

A survey of residency program directors in anesthesiology regarding mentorship of residents.,"Mentorship of residents has been extensively studied within many academic specialties, but not anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of formal mentorship programs among anesthesia residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the United States by surveying residency directors. The secondary goals of the study are to describe the programs that exist and identify areas that residency directors think should be the focus of mentoring. Our survey was designed based on previous surveys administered to residency program directors from other specialties. After determination of exempt status by our institutional review board, the survey was administered via e-mail to program directors of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited anesthesiology residencies. Response rate was 34% (45/131). The sample consisted of mainly university-based programs (93%). Most (88%) had a mentorship program in place. There was little consistency between methods of forming faculty-resident mentor pairs. Most mentors (84%) and mentees (79%) did not evaluate their programs. Nearly all program directors agree that mentorship is an important tool for resident development (90.6%) and that it is important to have a mentor during training (90.6%). Program directors identified the areas of career planning, professionalism, and achieving a balance between personal, career, and family demands to be the most valuable subjects to address in a mentoring relationship. Anesthesiology is currently underrepresented in the trainee mentoring literature. There is significant support for mentorship during resident training; however, the low rates of training for faculty and minimal evaluation by residents and faculty raise the question as to the efficacy of the existing programs. There is a need for more investigation of anesthesia residents' goals and perceptions of mentorship, and a more detailed evaluation of existing mentorship programs to determine the ideal structure of a mentoring program.","Gonzalez Laura Shank, Donnelly Melanie J",Journal of clinical anesthesia,2016.0,27555175,,10.1016/j.jclinane.2016.03.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27555175,,True,formal mentorship programs for anesthesiology residents,anesthesiology residents in ACGME-accredited programs,"resident development in career planning, professionalism, and work-life balance",True,"Mentorship program for residents, with methods of forming faculty-resident mentor pairs varying across programs.",Anesthesia residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the United States.,"Improved resident development, career planning, professionalism, and achieving a balance between personal, career, and family demands."
A Randomized Double-Blinded Trial on the Effects of Ultrasound Transducer Orientation on Teaching and Learning Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia.,"Learning ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia skills, especially needle/ beam alignment, can be especially difficulty for trainees, who can often become frustrated. We hypothesized that teaching novices to orient the transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders will improve performance on a standardized task, compared to holding the transducer and needle parallel to the shoulders. This study compared the effects of transducer orientation on trainees' ability to complete a standardized ultrasound-guided nerve block simulation. The time to task completion and percentage of the attempt time without adequate needle visualization were measured. Participants were right-handed healthy adults with no previous ultrasound experience and were randomly assigned to training in either transducer and needle alignment in a coronal plane, parallel to the shoulders (parallel group) or transducer and needle alignment in a sagittal plane, perpendicular to the shoulders (perpendicular group). Participants used ultrasound to direct a needle to 3 targets in a standardized gelatin phantom and repeated this task 3 times. Their efforts were timed and evaluated by an assessor, who was blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed on 28 participants. The perpendicular group was able to complete the task more quickly (P < .001) and with a smaller proportion of time lost to inadequate needle visualization (P < .001). Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia trainees complete a standardized task more quickly and efficiently when instructed to hold the transducer and needle in an orientation perpendicular to their shoulders.","Lam Nicholas C K, Baker Elizabeth B, Fishburn Steven J, Hammer Angie R, Petersen Timothy R, Mariano Edward R",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,2016.0,27246662,,10.7863/ultra.15.09031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27246662,,True,Teaching novices to orient the ultrasound transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders when learning ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Trainees/novices in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,"Improved performance, faster task completion, and better needle visualization during ultrasound-guided nerve block procedures",True,Teaching novices to orient the transducer and needle perpendicular to their shoulders in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia,Right-handed healthy adults with no previous ultrasound experience,Trainees complete a standardized task more quickly and efficiently
"A peer-designed selective in anesthesiology, critical care, and perioperative medicine for first- and second-year medical students.","The objective of this study was to design and implement a preclinical elective (termed selective) in anesthesiology, critical care, and perioperative medicine and to report survey results assessing the impact of the selective on first- and second-year medical students' understanding of basic concepts, comfort with procedural skills, and interest in the specialty. Preinvention and postintervention survey evaluation was used as the design of this study. The study was conducted at Mayo Medical School and Mayo Clinic. The participants in this study are first- and second-year medical students. A 1-week introductory anesthesiology curriculum was developed to include didactic sessions, shadowing experiences, lunch and dinner panels, mentorship and networking opportunities, and procedural workshops in airway management, ultrasound, and vascular access techniques. Preselective and postselective surveys using a 10-point scale (1, strongly disagree; 10, strongly agree) were administered 1 week before and after the selective. A total of 8 students participated in the selective, with a 100% survey response rate. Students reported significant increases for all survey questions regarding basic concepts and skills. The largest increases were reported in comfort with airway management skills, understanding of the perioperative surgical home model, and vascular access skills. All participants indicated a higher likelihood of pursuing anesthesiology as a career and attributed their increased interest in anesthesiology to the selective. This new selective was successful in giving first- and second-year medical students a comprehensive overview of anesthesiology and increasing medical student interest in the specialty. The success of this selective leads to promising belief that similar peer-designed educational experiences can be developed at other medical schools to improve education and interest in this area of medicine.","Tien Michael, Aiudi Christopher M, Sviggum Hans P, Long Timothy R",Journal of clinical anesthesia,2016.0,27185704,,10.1016/j.jclinane.2016.02.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27185704,,True,"A 1-week introductory anesthesiology curriculum including didactic sessions, shadowing experiences, panels, mentorship opportunities, and procedural workshops in airway management, ultrasound, and vascular access techniques",First- and second-year medical students,"Increased understanding of basic concepts, improved comfort with procedural skills, and greater interest in anesthesiology as a specialty",True,"A 1-week introductory anesthesiology curriculum was developed to include didactic sessions, shadowing experiences, lunch and dinner panels, mentorship and networking opportunities, and procedural workshops in airway management, ultrasound, and vascular access techniques.",First- and second-year medical students,"Students reported significant increases for all survey questions regarding basic concepts and skills.

A qualitative study exploring mentorship in anesthesiology: perspectives from both sides of the relationship.,"Mentorship has been shown to improve career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians. There is a current lack of studies investigating factors that either promote or hinder effective mentoring relationships through the perspectives of both faculty and residents. The aim of this study was to ascertain these factors and subsequently to provide guidance on designing residency mentorship programs. We used a qualitative design to examine mentorship experiences at the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology and conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 residents and 12 faculty in the mentorship program. Data were analyzed iteratively using a constant comparative method to identify themes resulting in positive or negative mentorship outcomes. As determined from both mentor and mentee perspectives, a successful mentorship program hinges on three key factors-i.e., the anticipated goals of a mentorship relationship, characteristics of the participants, and the structure of the program. When themes were compared between mentors and mentees, differences in their perception of the goals of the relationship and the structure of the program resulted in cases of disillusionment and negative mentorship outcomes. The concept of a mentorship network emerged as a possible solution that would meet the evolving needs of mentees as they progress through training. The network would involve each mentee acquiring multiple mentors, with each providing guidance for a mentee's diverse areas of interest. We identified three key factors that facilitate or hinder mentorship relationships and proposed solutions for designing effective mentorship programs for postgraduate training programs.","Alisic Sarika, Boet Sylvain, Sutherland Stephanie, Bould M Dylan",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2016.0,27060087,,10.1007/s12630-016-0649-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27060087,,True,Mentorship program with a proposed mentorship network where mentees acquire multiple mentors for guidance in diverse areas of interest,Residents and faculty in the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology,"Improved career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians through effective mentorship relationships",True,"Designing residency mentorship programs, with the concept of a mentorship network where each mentee acquires multiple mentors, each providing guidance for a mentee's diverse areas of interest.",Residents and faculty in the mentorship program at the University of Ottawa Department of Anesthesiology,"Improved career satisfaction, research productivity, and retention of academic physicians.

A Survey of Simulation Utilization in Anesthesiology Residency Programs in the United States.,"Given the evolution of competency-based education and evidence supporting the benefits of incorporating simulation into anesthesiology residency training, simulation will likely play an important role in the training and assessment of anesthesiology residents. Currently, there are little data available regarding the current status of simulation-based curricula across US residency programs. In this study, we assessed simulation-based training and assessment in US anesthesiology programs using a survey designed to elicit information regarding the type, frequency, and content of the simulation courses offered at the 132 Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education-certified anesthesiology training programs. The response rate for the survey was 66%. Although most of the responding programs offered simulation-based courses for interns and residents and during CA-1 orientation, the curriculum varied greatly among programs. Approximately 40% of responding programs use simulation for resident assessment and remediation. The majority of responding programs favored standard simulation-based training as part of residency training (89%), and the most common perceived obstacles to doing so were time, money, and human resources. The results from this survey highlight that there are currently large variations in simulation-based training and assessment among training programs. It also confirms that many program directors feel that standardizing some components of simulation-based education and assessment would be beneficial. Given the positive impact simulation has on skill retention and operating room preparedness, it may be worthwhile to consider developing a standard curriculum.","Rochlen Lauryn R, Housey Michelle, Gannon Ian, Tait Alan R, Naughton Norah, Kheterpal Sachin",A & A case reports,2016.0,26934609,,10.1213/XAA.0000000000000304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26934609,,True,simulation-based training during CA-1 orientation,"anesthesiology residents, particularly interns and CA-1 residents",improved skill retention and operating room preparedness,True,Simulation-based training and assessment,Anesthesiology residents,Skill retention and operating room preparedness
A survey of mentorship among Canadian anesthesiology residents.,"Mentorship in medicine is associated with increased career satisfaction and personal development. Despite these benefits, little is known about mentorship in anesthesiology training programs. Our objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of formal mentorship programs among anesthesiology training programs in Canada, (2) the prevalence of informal and formal mentorship among anesthesiology residents in Canada, and (3) the predictors of having an identified mentor among anesthesiology residents in Canada. We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey of residents and program directors from Canadian anesthesiology residency programs. Program directors were questioned about formal mentorship programs, and residents were asked to provide demographic data and information about their mentorship relationships. We analyzed the relationship between resident characteristics and mentorship. Our survey response rates were 76% and 39% for the Program Director Survey and the Resident Survey, respectively. Formal mentorship programs were present in 54% of residency training programs, and 94% of residents agreed that mentorship was important. Seventy-four percent of residents identified at least one mentor, although 42% of these residents did not interact regularly with their mentor. Mentors and mentees were more likely to be of the same gender. If a formal mentorship program was present, residents were more likely to identify a mentor (82 vs 17%) and interact regularly with their mentor (70 vs 46%). Formal mentorship programs were present in half of anesthesiology training programs. Although 74% of the residents identified a mentor, 42% did not interact regularly with their mentor. The presence of a formal mentorship program was positively associated with mentorship.","Zakus Paul, Gelb Adrian W, Flexman Alana M",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2015.0,26087911,,10.1007/s12630-015-0418-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26087911,,True,formal mentorship programs in anesthesiology training programs,anesthesiology residents in Canada,increased likelihood of residents identifying a mentor and interacting regularly with their mentor,True,Formal mentorship programs,Residents and program directors from Canadian anesthesiology residency programs,"Increased career satisfaction and personal development, more likely to identify a mentor and interact regularly with their mentor"
